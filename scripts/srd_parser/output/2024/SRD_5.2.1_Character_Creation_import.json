Throughout this chapter, we use the term \"character sheet\" to mean whatever you use to track your character's details, whether it's a printed character sheet, a digital character sheet, or plain paper. Choose whichever style of sheet works for you, and then embark on creating a character!\n\n---\n\n## Create Your Character\n\nHere are the steps to make a character; each step is explored in detail:\n\n**1: Choose a Class.** Every adventurer is a member of a class. A class broadly describes a character's vocation, special talents, and favored tactics.\n\n**2: Determine Origin.** A character's origin includes two elements: background and species. How did the character spend the years leading up to a life of adventure? Who are the character's ancestors? You can also choose your character's languages.\n\n**3: Determine Ability Scores.** Much of what your character does in the game depends on the character's six abilities.\n\n**4: Choose an Alignment.** Alignment is a shorthand for your character's moral compass.\n\n**5: Fill in Details.** Using the choices you've made, fill in the remaining details on your character sheet.\n\n---",

Typically, a character starts at level 1 and advances in level by adventuring and gaining Experience Points (XP).\n\n**Write Your XP.** Also record your Experience Points. A level 1 character has 0 XP.\n\n**Starting at a Higher Level.** Your GM might start you at a higher level. If you start at level 3 or higher, write your chosen subclass on your character sheet. See the \"Starting at Higher Levels\" section later in \"Character Creation\" for more information.\n\n### Note Armor Training\n\nYour class might give you training with certain categories of armor. Note your armor training on your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of armor means you can wear that armor effectively, gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of armor are described in \"Equipment.\"",

      "name": "Step 2: Character Origin",
      "description": "Determining your character's origin involves choosing a background, a species, and two languages.\n\nA character's background represents the place and occupation that were most formative for the character. The combination of background, species, and languages provides fertile soil for your imagination as you ponder your character's earliest days.\n\n### Choose a Background\n\nChoose your character's background, and write it on your character sheet. You can choose any of the backgrounds detailed in \"Character Origins,\" and your GM might offer additional backgrounds as options.\n\nThe background you choose influences step 3, when you determine your character's ability scores. If you're having trouble choosing, the following table shows which backgrounds benefit which ability scores. Look for your class's primary ability there.\n\n| Ability | Background |\n|---------|------------|\n| Strength | Soldier |\n| Dexterity | Soldier |\n| Constitution | Soldier |\n| Intelligence | Acolyte |\n| Wisdom | Acolyte |\n| Charisma | Acolyte |\n\n**Record Your Feat.** A background gives you a feat, which grants your character particular capabilities. Feats are detailed in \"Feats.\" Write the feat on your character sheet.\n\n**Note Proficiencies.** Your background gives proficiency in two skills and with one tool. Record this information on your character sheet.\n\nYour class also gives proficiencies. Check your class description in \"Classes\" and note the proficiencies on your character sheet.\n\nThe features table in your class description shows your Proficiency Bonus (described in \"Playing the Game\"), which is +2 for a level 1 character. Note this number on your character sheet. You'll fill in other numbers connected to these proficiencies in step 5.\n\n### Choose Starting Equipment\n\nYour background and class both provide starting equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step can be immediately spent on equipment from \"Equipment.\"\n\nRecord your chosen equipment on your character sheet. Equipment is described in \"Equipment,\" but for now you can just write it all down and look up the specifics in \"Equipment\" later. Note any coins you have left after purchasing your equipment.\n\n### Choose a Species\n\nChoose a species for your character. The following species options are detailed in \"Character Origins\": Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling, Human, Orc, and Tiefling. Once you've chosen a species, write it on your character sheet. Then record your species' traits.\n\nYour character's size and Speed are determined by the character's species; record these in the appropriate places on your character sheet as well (you may write just the first letter of your size).\n\n### Imagine Your Past and Present\n\nLet your character's background and species inspire how you imagine their past. That past fed into the character's present. With that in mind, consider answers to the following questions as your character:\n\n- Who raised you?\n- Who was your dearest childhood friend?\n- Did you grow up with a pet?\n- Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?\n- Did you join an organization, such as a guild or religion? If so, are you still a member of it?\n- What elements of your past inspire you to go on adventures now?\n\n### Choose Languages\n\nYour character knows at least three languages: Common plus two languages you roll or choose from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a language means your character can communicate in it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features might also give you languages.\n\n**Standard Languages**\n\n| 1d12 | Language |\n|------|----------|\n| \u2014 | Common |\n| 1 | Common Sign Language |\n| 2 | Draconic |\n| 3\u20134 | Dwarvish |\n| 5\u20136 | Elvish |\n| 7 | Giant |\n| 8 | Gnomish |\n| 9 | Goblin |\n| 10\u201311 | Halfling |\n| 12 | Orc |\n\n**Rare Languages**\n\n| Language | Language |\n|----------|----------|\n| Abyssal | Primordial* |\n| Celestial | Sylvan |\n| Deep Speech | Thieves' Cant |\n| Druidic | Undercommon |\n| Infernal | |\n\n*Primordial includes the Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran dialects. Creatures that know one of these dialects can communicate with those that know a different one.",

      "description": "To determine your character's ability scores, you first generate a set of six numbers using the instructions below and then assign them to your six abilities. \"Playing the Game\" explains what each ability means.\n\n### Generate Your Scores\n\nDetermine your ability scores by using one of the following three methods. Your GM might prefer you to use a particular one.\n\n**Standard Array.** Use the following six scores for your abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.\n\n**Random Generation.** Roll four d6s and record the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more times, so you have six numbers.\n\n**Point Cost.** You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Costs table.\n\n| Score | Cost | Score | Cost |\n|-------|------|-------|------|\n| 8 | 0 | 12 | 4 |\n| 9 | 1 | 13 | 5 |\n| 10 | 2 | 14 | 7 |\n| 11 | 3 | 15 | 9 |\n\n### Assign Ability Scores\n\nOnce you've generated six scores, assign them to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class's primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well.\n\nIf you're using the Standard Array option, consult the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions on where to assign scores for your character's class. The table puts the highest scores in a class's main abilities. If you used a different method to generate the scores, you may still use this table to guide where you place your highest and lowest scores.\n\n| Class | Str. | Dex. | Con. | Int. | Wis. | Cha. |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Barbarian | 15 | 13 | 14 | 10 | 12 | 8 |\n| Bard | 8 | 14 | 12 | 13 | 10 | 15 |\n| Cleric | 14 | 8 | 13 | 10 | 15 | 12 |\n| Druid | 8 | 12 | 14 | 13 | 15 | 10 |\n| Fighter | 15 | 14 | 13 | 8 | 10 | 12 |\n| Monk | 12 | 15 | 13 | 10 | 14 | 8 |\n| Paladin | 15 | 10 | 13 | 8 | 12 | 14 |\n| Ranger | 12 | 15 | 13 | 8 | 14 | 10 |\n| Rogue | 12 | 15 | 13 | 14 | 10 | 8 |\n| Sorcerer | 10 | 13 | 14 | 8 | 12 | 15 |\n| Warlock | 8 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 10 | 15 |\n| Wizard | 8 | 12 | 13 | 15 | 14 | 10 |\n\n### Adjust Ability Scores\n\nAfter assigning your ability scores, adjust them according to your background. Your background lists three abilities; increase one of those scores by 2 and a different one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of these increases can raise a score above 20.\n\nSome players like to increase their class's primary ability, while others prefer to increase a low score.\n\n### Determine Ability Modifiers\n\nFinally, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. Write the modifier next to each of your scores.\n\n| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |\n|-------|----------|-------|----------|\n| 3 | \u22124 | 12\u201313 | +1 |\n| 4\u20135 | \u22123 | 14\u201315 | +2 |\n| 6\u20137 | \u22122 | 16\u201317 | +3 |\n| 8\u20139 | \u22121 | 18\u201319 | +4 |\n| 10\u201311 | +0 | 20 | +5 |",

      "description": "Choose your character's alignment from the options below, and note it on your character sheet.\n\nThe game assumes that player characters aren't of an evil alignment. Check with your GM before making an evil character.\n\n### The Nine Alignments\n\nA creature's alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).\n\nThe summaries of the alignments below describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment; individuals can vary from that behavior.\n\n**Lawful Good (LG).** Lawful Good creatures endeavor to do the right thing as expected by society. Someone who fights injustice and protects the innocent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.\n\n**Neutral Good (NG).** Neutral Good creatures do the best they can, working within rules but not feeling bound by them. A kindly person who helps others according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.\n\n**Chaotic Good (CG).** Chaotic Good creatures act as their conscience directs with little regard for what others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron's tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the poor is probably Chaotic Good.\n\n**Lawful Neutral (LN).** Lawful Neutral individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of life\u2014and isn't swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil\u2014is probably Lawful Neutral.\n\n**Neutral (N).** Neutral is the alignment of those who prefer to avoid moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Someone who's bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.\n\n**Chaotic Neutral (CN).** Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.\n\n**Lawful Evil (LE).** Lawful Evil creatures methodically take what they want within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploiting citizens while scheming for power is probably Lawful Evil.\n\n**Neutral Evil (NE).** Neutral Evil is the alignment of those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.\n\n**Chaotic Evil (CE).** Chaotic Evil creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or bloodlust. A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance and havoc is probably Chaotic Evil.\n\n> **Unaligned Creatures**\n>\n> Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought don't have alignments; they are unaligned. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they aren't evil; they are unaligned.",

The class features are detailed there too.\n\nSome class features offer choices. Make sure to read all your features and make any offered choices.\n\n### Fill In Numbers\n\nNote these numbers on your character sheet.\n\n**Saving Throws.** For the saving throws you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the appropriate ability modifier and note the total. Some players also like to note the modifier for saving throws they're not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.\n\n**Skills.** For skills you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated with that skill, and note the total. You might also wish to note the modifier for skills you're not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.\n\n**Passive Perception.** Sometimes your GM will determine whether your character notices something without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check; the GM uses your Passive Perception instead. Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general awareness of your surroundings when you're not actively looking for something. Use this formula to determine your Passive Perception score:\n\n> Passive Perception = 10 + Wisdom (Perception) check modifier\n\nInclude all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom (Perception) checks. For example, if your character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Perception skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency).\n\n**Hit Points.** Your class and Constitution modifier determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1.\n\n| Class | Hit Point Maximum |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| Barbarian | 12 + Con. modifier |\n| Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger | 10 + Con. modifier |\n| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock | 8 + Con. modifier |\n| Sorcerer or Wizard | 6 + Con. modifier |\n\nThe character sheet includes room to note your current Hit Points when you take damage, as well as any Temporary Hit Points you might gain. There's also space to track Death Saving Throws.\n\n**Hit Point Dice.** Your class's description tells you the die type of your character's Hit Point Dice (or Hit Dice for short); write this on your character sheet. At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space to note how many Hit Dice you've spent.\n\n**Initiative.** Write your Dexterity modifier in the space for Initiative on your character sheet.\n\n**Armor Class.** Without armor or a shield, your base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If your starting equipment includes armor or a Shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in \"Equipment.\" A class feature might give you a different way to calculate your AC.\n\n**Attacks.** In the Weapons & Damage Cantrips section of the character sheet, write your starting weapons. The attack roll bonus for a weapon with which you have proficiency is one of the following unless a weapon's property says otherwise:\n\n> Melee attack bonus = Strength modifier + Proficiency Bonus\n>\n> Ranged attack bonus = Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus\n\nLook up the damage and properties of your weapons in \"Equipment.\" You add the same ability modifier you use for attacks with a weapon to your damage rolls with that weapon.\n\n**Spellcasting.** Note both the saving throw DC for your spells and the attack bonus for attacks you make with them, using these formulas:\n\n> Spell save DC = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus\n>\n> Spell attack bonus = spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus\n\nYour spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is determined by whatever feature gives you the ability to cast the spell.\n\n**Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells.** If your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, your class features table shows the number of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips you know, and how many spells you can prepare. Choose your cantrips and prepared spells, and note them\u2014along with your number of spell slots\u2014on your character sheet.",

Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, follow the rules for that class.\n\n**Spells Prepared.** You determine what spells you can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example, you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as well as four Sorcerer cantrips).\n\nEach spell you prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell.\n\n**Cantrips.** If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, unless the spell says otherwise.\n\n**Spell Slots.** You determine your available spell slots by adding together the following:\n\n- All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard classes\n- Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and Ranger classes\n\nThen look up this total level in the Level column of the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.\n\nThis table might give you spell slots of a higher level than the spells you prepare. You can use those slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like Burning Hands, has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level, you can use the enhanced effect as normal.\n\n**Pact Magic.** If you have the Pact Magic feature from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature, you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic to cast spells you have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast Warlock spells you have prepared.\n\n**Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level**\n\n| Level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 2 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 2 | 3 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 3 | 4 | 2 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 4 | 4 | 3 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 6 | 4 | 3 | 3 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 7 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 8 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 9 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 10 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 11 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 12 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 13 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 14 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 15 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | \u2014 |\n| 16 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | \u2014 |\n| 17 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 18 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 19 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 20 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |",
