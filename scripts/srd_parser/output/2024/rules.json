That \"you\" refers to the creature or object that the rule applies to in a particular moment of play.\n\n**\"See Also.\"** Some glossary entries include a See Also section that points to other entries in the glossary or to other parts of the document.\n\n**Round Down.** Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.

    "description": "The three main pillars of D&D play are social interaction, exploration, and combat. Whichever one you're experiencing, the game unfolds according to this basic pattern:\n\n**1: The Game Master Describes a Scene.** The GM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, and so on).\n\n**2: The Players Describe What Their Characters Do.** Typically, the characters stick together as they travel through a dungeon or another environment. Sometimes different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines a mysterious symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the GM ensures that every character has a chance to act and decides how to resolve their activity. In combat, the characters take turns.\n\n**3: The GM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers' Actions.** Sometimes resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to open a door, the GM might say the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the GM might ask the player to roll a die to help determine what happens. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the game back to step 1.\n\nThis pattern holds during every game session (each time you sit down to play D&D), whether the adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or fighting a dragon. In certain situations\u2014particularly combat\u2014the action is more structured, and everyone takes turns. \n\n> ### Exceptions Supercede General Rules\n> General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn't explicitly say otherwise.\n>\n> The game also includes elements\u2014class features, feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like\u2014that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.",

Roleplaying is part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions.\n\nThe GM uses an NPC's personality and your character's actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly bandit might buckle under threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant refuses to help if the characters badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.\n\nWhen interacting with an NPC, pay attention to the GM's portrayal of the NPC's personality.

That interaction must occur during a creature's movement or action. Any additional interactions require the Utilize action.\n\n**Finding Hidden Objects.** When your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided you describe the character searching in the hidden object's vicinity.\n\n**Carrying Objects.** You can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight. If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the GM might require you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity in \"Rules Glossary.\"\n\n**Breaking Objects.** As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece of paper.

For example, if an ambusher starts combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware that combat is starting, that foe is surprised.\n\n**Initiative Order.** A combatant's check total is called their Initiative count, or Initiative for short.

    "description": "When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it either dies outright or falls unconscious, as explained below.\n\n**Instant Death.** Here are the main ways a creature can die instantly:\n- **Monster Death.** A monster dies the instant it drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Game Master can ignore this rule for an individual monster and treat it like a character.\n- **Hit Point Maximum of 0.** A creature dies if its Hit Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life energy, reducing a creature's Hit Point maximum.\n- **Massive Damage.** When damage reduces a character to 0 Hit Points and damage remains, the character dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their Hit Point maximum.\n\n**Character Demise.** If your character dies, others might find a magical way to revive your character, such as with the Raise Dead spell. Or talk with the GM about making a new character to join the group.\n\n**Falling Unconscious.** If you reach 0 Hit Points and don't die instantly, you have the Unconscious condition until you regain any Hit Points, and you now face making Death Saving Throws.",

    "name": "Death Saving Throws",
    "description": "Whenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Points, you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to an ability score. You're in the hands of fate now.\n\n**Three Successes/Failures.** Roll 1d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become Stable. On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any Hit Points or become Stable.\n\n**Rolling a 1 or 20.** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 Hit Point.\n\n**Damage at 0 Hit Points.** If you take any damage while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Saving Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.",

    "name": "Stabilizing a Character",
    "description": "You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.\n\nA Stable creature doesn't make Death Saving Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still has the Unconscious condition. If the creature takes damage, it stops being Stable and starts making Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours.",

  {
    "name": "Temporary Hit Points",
    "description": "Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit Points.\n\n**Lose Temporary Hit Points First.** If you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage, those points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your Hit Points.\n\n**Duration.** Temporary Hit Points last until they're depleted or you finish a Long Rest.\n\n**They Don't Stack.** Temporary Hit Points can't be added together. If you have Temporary Hit Points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones.\n\n**They're Not Hit Points or Healing.** Temporary Hit Points can't be added to your Hit Points, healing can't restore them, and receiving Temporary Hit Points doesn't count as healing. Because Temporary Hit Points aren't Hit Points, a creature can be at full Hit Points and receive Temporary Hit Points. If you have 0 Hit Points, receiving Temporary Hit Points doesn't restore you to consciousness. Only true healing can save you.\n\n---\n\n*Source: System Reference Document 5.2.1 \u2014 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License*",
