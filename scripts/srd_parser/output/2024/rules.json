    "description": "When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game uses a d20 roll to determine success or failure. These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. They follow these steps:\n\n1. **Roll 1d20.** You always want to roll high. If the roll has Advantage or Disadvantage, you roll two d20s, but you use the number from only one of them - the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower one if you have Disadvantage.\n\n2. **Add Modifiers.** Add these modifiers to the number rolled on the d20:\n   - The Relevant Ability Modifier\n   - Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant\n   - Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties\n\n3. **Compare the Total to a Target Number.** If the total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or exceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).\n\n## Ability Checks\n\nAn ability check represents a creature using talent and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertaining a crowd, or deciphering a cipher.\n\n### Ability Check Examples\n\n| Ability | Make a Check To... |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| Strength | Lift, push, pull or break something |\n| Dexterity | Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly |\n| Constitution | Push your body beyond normal limits |\n| Intelligence | Reason or remember |\n| Wisdom | Notice things in the environment or in creatures' behavior |\n| Charisma | Influence, entertain, or deceive |\n\n### Typical Difficulty Classes\n\n| Task Difficulty | DC |\n|-----------------|-----|\n| Very easy | 5 |\n| Easy | 10 |\n| Medium | 15 |\n| Hard | 20 |\n| Very hard | 25 |\n| Nearly impossible | 30 |\n\n## Saving Throws\n\nA saving throw represents an attempt to evade or resist a threat, such as a fiery explosion, a blast of poisonous gas, or a spell trying to invade your mind. You don't normally choose to make a save; you must make one because your character is at risk.\n\n### Saving Throw Examples\n\n| Ability | Make a Save To... |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| Strength | Physically resist direct force |\n| Dexterity | Dodge out of harm's way |\n| Constitution | Endure a toxic hazard |\n| Intelligence | Recognize an illusion as fake |\n| Wisdom | Resist a mental assault |\n| Charisma | Assert your identity |\n\n## Attack Rolls\n\nAn attack roll determines whether an attack hits a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class.\n\n### Attack Roll Abilities\n\n| Ability | Attack Type |\n|---------|------------|\n| Strength | Melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike |\n| Dexterity | Ranged attack with a weapon |\n| Varies | Spell attack (determined by the spellcaster's spellcasting feature) |\n\n### Rolling 20 or 1\n\nIf you roll a 20 on the d20 (a \"natural 20\") for an attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a Critical Hit. If you roll a 1 (a \"natural 1\"), the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.\n\n## Advantage and Disadvantage\n\nAdvantage reflects positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while Disadvantage reflects negative circumstances.\n\n**Roll Two D20s:** When a roll has either Advantage or Disadvantage, roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and use the lower roll if you have Disadvantage.\n\n**They Don't Stack:** If multiple situations affect a roll and they all grant Advantage, you still roll only two d20s. Similarly, if multiple situations impose Disadvantage, you roll only two d20s. If circumstances cause a roll to have both Advantage and Disadvantage, the roll has neither of them, and you roll one d20.\n\n### Heroic Inspiration\n\nIf you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you must use the new roll. You can never have more than one instance of Heroic Inspiration."

    "description": "Exploration involves delving into places that are dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this section detail some of the ways adventurers interact with the environment in such places.\n\n## Adventuring Equipment\n\nAs adventurers explore, their equipment can help them in many ways. For example, they can reach out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things they wouldn't otherwise notice with a Torch or another light source, bypass locked doors and containers with Thieves' Tools, and create obstacles for pursuers with Caltrops.\n\n## Vision and Light\n\nSome adventuring tasks - such as noticing danger, hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells - are affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can hinder you.\n\n### Obscured Areas\n\nAn area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a Lightly Obscured area - such as an area with Dim Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage - you have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n\nA Heavily Obscured area - such as an area with Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage - is opaque. You have the Blinded condition when trying to see something there.\n\n### Light Levels\n\n**Bright Light.** Bright Light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.\n\n**Dim Light.** Dim Light, also called shadows, creates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light is usually a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as Dim Light.\n\n**Darkness.** Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.\n\n### Special Senses\n\nSome creatures have special senses that help them perceive things in certain situations:\n- Blindsight\n- Darkvision\n- Tremorsense\n- Truesight\n\n## Hiding\n\nAdventurers and monsters often hide, whether to spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an ambush. The Game Master decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, you take the Hide action.\n\n## Interacting with Objects\n\nInteracting with objects is often simple to resolve. The player tells the GM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever or opening a door, and the GM describes what happens.\n\n### Time-Limited Object Interactions\n\nWhen time is short, such as in combat, interactions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That interaction must occur during a creature's movement or action. Any additional interactions require the Utilize action.\n\n## Travel\n\nDuring an adventure, the characters might travel long distances on trips that could take hours or days. The GM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times, or the GM might have you use the travel pace rules below.\n\n### Travel Pace Table\n\n| Pace | Distance Per Minute | Per Hour | Per Day |\n|------|---------------------|----------|--------|\n| Fast | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles |\n| Normal | 300 feet | 3 miles | 24 miles |\n| Slow | 200 feet | 2 miles | 18 miles |\n\n**Fast.** Traveling at a Fast pace imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n\n**Normal.** Traveling at a Normal pace imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n\n**Slow.** Traveling at a Slow pace grants Advantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks."

    "category": "Combat",
    "description": "Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat often breaks out.\n\n## The Order of Combat\n\nA typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side is defeated.\n\n### Combat Step by Step\n\n1. **Establish Positions.** The Game Master determines where all the characters and monsters are located.\n2. **Roll Initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.\n3. **Take Turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat this step until the fighting stops.\n\n### Initiative\n\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check that determines their place in the Initiative order. The GM rolls for monsters.\n\n**Surprise.** If a combatant is surprised by combat starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their Initiative roll.\n\n### Your Turn\n\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your Speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first.\n\n**Communicating.** You can communicate however you are able - through brief utterances and gestures - as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither your action nor your move.\n\n**Interacting with Things.** You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or action.\n\n## Movement and Position\n\nOn your turn, you can move a distance equal to your Speed or less. Or you can decide not to move.\n\n### Playing on a Grid\n\n**Squares.** Each square represents 5 feet.\n\n**Speed.** Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid, using your Speed in 5-foot segments.\n\n### Creature Size and Space\n\n| Size | Space (Feet) | Space (Squares) |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| Tiny | 2.5 by 2.5 feet | 4 per square |\n| Small | 5 by 5 feet | 1 square |\n| Medium | 5 by 5 feet | 1 square |\n| Large | 10 by 10 feet | 4 squares (2 by 2) |\n| Huge | 15 by 15 feet | 9 squares (3 by 3) |\n| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 feet | 16 squares (4 by 4) |\n\n### Difficult Terrain\n\nEvery foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs 1 extra foot, even if multiple things in a space count as Difficult Terrain.\n\n## Making an Attack\n\nWhen you take the Attack action, you make an attack. Some other actions, Bonus Actions, and Reactions also let you make an attack.\n\n1. **Choose a Target.** Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.\n2. **Determine Modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has Cover and whether you have Advantage or Disadvantage against the target.\n3. **Resolve the Attack.** Make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage.\n\n## Cover\n\n| Degree | Benefit to Target | Offered By... |\n|--------|------------------|---------------|\n| Half | +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws | Another creature or an object that covers at least half of the target |\n| Three-Quarters | +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws | An object that covers at least three-quarters of the target |\n| Total | Can't be targeted directly | An object that covers the whole target |\n\n## Opportunity Attacks\n\nCombatants watch for enemies to drop their guard. If you move heedlessly past your foes, you put yourself in danger by provoking an Opportunity Attack.\n\n**Avoiding Opportunity Attacks.** You can avoid provoking an Opportunity Attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an Opportunity Attack when you Teleport or when you are moved without using your movement, action, Bonus Action, or Reaction.\n\n**Making an Opportunity Attack.** You can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can see leaves your reach. To make the attack, take a Reaction to make one melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike against that creature."

    "description": "## Hit Points\n\nHit Points represent durability and the will to live. Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult to kill. Your maximum is your uninjured amount, ranging down to 0. Damage reduces your current Hit Points until reaching zero.\n\nWhen your Hit Points drop to half or lower, you become Bloodied, which may trigger certain effects but has no inherent mechanical consequence.\n\n## Damage Rolls\n\nEach weapon, spell, and monster ability specifies damage dealt. Roll damage dice, add modifiers, and apply to the target. Penalties cannot result in negative damage - minimum is 0.\n\nWhen attacking with a weapon, add the same ability modifier used for the attack roll. Spells specify which dice and modifiers apply.\n\n## Critical Hits\n\nOn a Critical Hit, roll all damage dice twice, combine them, then add modifiers normally. For example, a Critical Hit with a Dagger deals 2d4 plus your modifier instead of 1d4. Additional damage dice from features (like Sneak Attack) also roll twice.\n\n## Damage Types\n\nEach damage instance has a type (Fire, Slashing, etc.). Types have no inherent mechanics but interact with Resistance, Vulnerability, and related rules.\n\n## Resistance and Vulnerability\n\nCreatures with Resistance to a damage type take half that damage (rounded down). Those with Vulnerability take double. Multiple instances of the same Resistance or Vulnerability count as one.\n\n### Order of Application\n\n1. Apply adjustments (bonuses, penalties, multipliers)\n2. Apply Resistance\n3. Apply Vulnerability\n\n## Immunity\n\nImmunity to a damage type means taking no damage of that type. Immunity to conditions means not being affected by them.\n\n## Healing\n\nHit Points can be restored by magic, such as the Cure Wounds spell or a Potion of Healing, or by a Short or Long Rest. When healed, add restored points to current Hit Points, capped at your maximum.\n\n## Dropping to 0 Hit Points\n\n### Instant Death\n\n**Monster Death:** Monsters die immediately upon reaching 0 Hit Points (GMs may override this).\n\n**Hit Point Maximum of 0:** Creatures die if their maximum becomes 0.\n\n**Massive Damage:** If damage reduces a character to 0 Hit Points with remaining damage equaling or exceeding their maximum, the character dies.\n\n### Falling Unconscious\n\nReaching 0 Hit Points without instant death causes the Unconscious condition. You then make Death Saving Throws.\n\n### Death Saving Throws\n\nStarting your turn at 0 Hit Points requires a Death Saving Throw (DC 10, roll 1d20). Three successes stabilize you; three failures mean death. Track both separately.\n\nRolling a 1 counts as two failures. Rolling a 20 restores 1 Hit Point. Taking damage while at 0 Hit Points causes a failure (two if critical). Damage equaling or exceeding your maximum causes instant death.\n\n### Stabilizing a Character\n\nUse the Help action and succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to stabilize someone at 0 Hit Points. Stable creatures don't make Death Saves but remain Unconscious. Taking damage resumes saves. Unhealed Stable creatures regain 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours.\n\n## Temporary Hit Points\n\nTemporary Hit Points serve as damage absorption before actual Hit Points are affected.\n\n**Lose Temporary Hit Points First:** Temporary points deplete before actual Hit Points. Overflow carries to actual Hit Points.\n\n**Duration:** Temporary Hit Points last until depleted or you finish a Long Rest.\n\n**They Don't Stack:** You cannot combine multiple sources. Choose to keep existing points or gain new ones instead.\n\n**They're Not Hit Points or Healing:** Temporary Hit Points can't be added to your Hit Points, healing can't restore them, and receiving Temporary Hit Points doesn't count as healing. At 0 Hit Points, only true healing restores consciousness."

    "category": "Magic",
    "description": "Spellcasting is a fundamental part of D&D, enabling characters to perform magical feats. This section covers the rules for gaining, preparing, and casting spells.\n\n## Gaining Spells\n\nBefore casting a spell, you must have it prepared mentally or access it via magic items like Spell Scrolls. Your class features specify which spells you can access and how preparation works.\n\n### Preparing Spells\n\nIf your class has preparable spells, the timing and quantity depend on your class:\n\n| Class | Change When | Number |\n|-------|------------|--------|\n| Bard | Gain level | One |\n| Cleric | Long Rest | Any |\n| Druid | Long Rest | Any |\n| Paladin | Long Rest | One |\n| Ranger | Long Rest | One |\n| Sorcerer | Gain level | One |\n| Warlock | Gain level | One |\n| Wizard | Long Rest | Any |\n\n**Always-Prepared Spells.** Certain features grant spells you always have prepared, which don't count toward your preparation limit.\n\n## Casting Spells\n\n### Casting in Armor\n\nYou must have training with any armor you are wearing to cast spells while wearing it. If you lack proficiency with the armor you're wearing, you cannot cast spells.\n\n### Spell Levels\n\nSpells range from level 0 to level 9, indicating their power level. Cantrips—simple spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0.\n\n### Spell Slots\n\nWhen you cast a spell of level 1 or higher, you expend a slot of that spell's level or higher. Spell slots are restored after a Long Rest (or Short Rest for some classes like Warlocks).\n\n### Casting Without Slots\n\n**Cantrips.** Level 0 spells can be cast at will without expending spell slots.\n\n**Rituals.** Spells with the Ritual tag can be cast in a ritual version that takes 10 minutes longer but doesn't expend a spell slot.\n\n**Special Abilities.** Some class features and feats allow you to cast certain spells without expending a slot, typically once per Long Rest.\n\n**Magic Items.** Spell Scrolls and other magic items may allow you to cast spells without using your own spell slots.\n\n### Using Higher-Level Spell Slots\n\nWhen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. Some spells have more powerful effects when cast at higher levels, as detailed in the spell's description.\n\n### One Spell Slot Per Turn\n\nOn a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast a spell. This means if you cast a spell as a Bonus Action, any other spell you cast on that turn must be a cantrip with a casting time of one action.\n\n### Schools of Magic\n\nEight schools categorize spells by their effect type:\n- **Abjuration:** Protective spells\n- **Conjuration:** Transporting objects and creatures\n- **Divination:** Revealing information\n- **Enchantment:** Affecting minds\n- **Evocation:** Channeling energy for damage or healing\n- **Illusion:** Deceiving the senses\n- **Necromancy:** Manipulating life force\n- **Transmutation:** Changing properties\n\n## Casting Time\n\nMost spells require one action to cast using the Magic action. Some spells use a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or take 1 minute or longer.\n\n### Longer Casting Times\n\nSpells requiring 1 minute or longer demand the Magic action each turn and maintained Concentration. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails but you don't lose the spell slot.\n\n## Range\n\nSpells have ranges expressed as a distance in feet, Touch, or Self. Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by range unless the spell description says otherwise.\n\n## Components\n\nSpells may require Verbal (V), Somatic (S), or Material (M) components.\n\n**Verbal (V).** Casting requires speaking mystic words. Being silenced prevents spells with V components.\n\n**Somatic (S).** Casting requires hand gestures. You must have a free hand or be holding your spellcasting focus.\n\n**Material (M).** Casting requires specific items. A Component Pouch or Spellcasting Focus can substitute for most material components (unless the component has a listed cost or is consumed).\n\n## Duration and Concentration\n\n**Instantaneous.** The spell's magic vanishes immediately after casting.\n\n**Concentration.** The spell requires ongoing focus. You can end Concentration at any time. Concentration breaks if you cast another Concentration spell, become Incapacitated, or fail a Constitution saving throw after taking damage (DC 10 or half the damage, whichever is higher).\n\n**Time Span.** Some spells last for a specific duration and can be dismissed without an action if you're not Incapacitated.\n\n## Targets and Areas of Effect\n\n### Targets\n\nCasters select targets the spell affects. To target something with a spell, you must have a clear path to it.\n\n**Targeting Yourself.** You're a valid target for most spells unless the spell requires a hostile creature.\n\n**Invalid Targets.** If a target is invalid (like targeting a creature immune to the spell), the spell slot is expended but the spell has no effect.\n\n### Areas of Effect\n\nSpells may affect areas rather than specific targets:\n- **Cone:** Extends in a direction from the point of origin\n- **Cube:** Fixed size from a point of origin\n- **Cylinder:** Circular base with a height\n- **Emanation:** Extends outward from a creature\n- **Line:** Extends in a direction with a fixed width\n- **Sphere:** Extends from a central point\n\n## Saving Throws and Attack Rolls\n\n**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus\n\n**Spell Attack Modifier** = your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus\n\n### Combining Magical Effects\n\nDifferent spells stack their effects. However, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine—only the most powerful or most recent effect applies."

    "description": "## Overview\n\nYour Game Master can start your party at a level higher than 1. This is particularly recommended at level 3 for experienced D&D players.\n\n## Creating Your Character\n\nTo create a higher-level character, follow the standard character-creation steps and apply the rules for level advancement. You begin with the minimum XP required for your starting level. For instance, starting at level 10 means beginning with 64,000 XP.\n\n### Bonus Feats at Level 20\n\nGMs can award feats as advancement beyond level 20. Characters gain one feat of their choice for every 30,000 XP earned above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon feats are particularly suitable, though players may select any feat their level 20 character qualifies for.\n\n## Starting Equipment\n\nYour GM determines whether you receive additional equipment beyond the standard level 1 package, potentially including magic items. The following table provides guidance:\n\n| Starting Level | Equipment and Money | Magic Items |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2–4 | Normal starting equipment | 1 Common |\n| 5–10 | 500 GP + 1d10 × 25 GP + normal equipment | 1 Common, 1 Uncommon |\n| 11–16 | 5,000 GP + 1d10 × 250 GP + normal equipment | 2 Common, 3 Uncommon, 1 Rare |\n| 17–20 | 20,000 GP + 1d10 × 250 GP + normal equipment | 2 Common, 4 Uncommon, 3 Rare, 1 Very Rare |\n\nConsult your GM about available equipment purchases and whether special items like firearms are accessible."

    "description": "## Choose a Character Sheet\n\nUse whichever character sheet format works best for you—printed, digital, or paper—to record your character's details throughout creation.\n\n## Create Your Character\n\nFollow these five steps to build your character:\n\n1. **Choose a Class** - Select your character's vocation and special talents\n2. **Determine Origin** - Pick background, species, and languages\n3. **Determine Ability Scores** - Generate and assign your six core abilities\n4. **Choose an Alignment** - Define your character's moral compass\n5. **Fill in Details** - Complete remaining calculations and selections\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Choose Class\n\nSelect a class and write it on your character sheet. Reference the Class Overview table to see each class's primary focus, main ability, and complexity level.\n\n### Class Overview\n\n| Class | Likes | Primary Ability | Complexity |\n|-------|-------|-----------------|------------|\n| Barbarian | Battle | Strength | Average |\n| Bard | Performing | Charisma | High |\n| Cleric | Gods | Wisdom | Average |\n| Druid | Nature | Wisdom | High |\n| Fighter | Weapons | Str or Dex | Low |\n| Monk | Unarmed combat | Dex & Wis | High |\n| Paladin | Defense | Str & Cha | Average |\n| Ranger | Survival | Dex & Wis | Average |\n| Rogue | Stealth | Dexterity | Low |\n| Sorcerer | Power | Charisma | High |\n| Warlock | Occult lore | Charisma | High |\n| Wizard | Spellbooks | Intelligence | Average |\n\n### Write Your Level\n\nEnter your character's level on the sheet.

A level 1 character has 0 XP.\n\n**Starting at a Higher Level** - If your GM begins play at level 3 or higher, also note your chosen subclass.\n\n### Note Armor Training\n\nWrite down any armor categories your class trains you to use effectively.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Character Origin\n\nCharacter origin encompasses background selection, species choice, and language acquisition.\n\n### Choose a Background\n\nSelect a background reflecting your character's formative place and occupation.\n\n**Record Your Feat** - Your background grants you a feat. Write this capability on your sheet.\n\n**Note Proficiencies** - Your background provides proficiency in two skills and one tool. Your class also grants proficiencies; check your class description and record all proficiencies together. At level 1, your Proficiency Bonus is +2.\n\n### Choose Starting Equipment\n\nBoth your background and class provide equipment. Any starting coins can purchase additional gear from the Equipment section.\n\n### Choose a Species\n\nPick from: Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling, Human, Orc, or Tiefling. Write your choice and record the species' traits. Also note your character's size and Speed as determined by species.\n\n### Imagine Your Past and Present\n\nUse your background and species to inspire your character's history. Consider:\n\n- Who raised you?\n- Who was your dearest childhood friend?\n- Did you grow up with a pet?\n- Have you fallen in love? With whom?\n- Did you join an organization like a guild or religion?\n- What past elements inspire your adventuring?\n\n### Choose Languages\n\nYour character knows Common plus two additional languages.\n\n#### Standard Languages\n\n| 1d12 | Language |\n|------|----------|\n| — | Common |\n| 1 | Common Sign Language |\n| 2 | Draconic |\n| 3–4 | Dwarvish |\n| 5–6 | Elvish |\n| 7 | Giant |\n| 8 | Gnomish |\n| 9 | Goblin |\n| 10–11 | Halfling |\n| 12 | Orc |\n\n#### Rare Languages\n\nAbyssal, Celestial, Deep Speech, Druidic, Infernal, Primordial (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, Terran), Sylvan, Thieves' Cant, Undercommon.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Ability Scores\n\nGenerate six ability scores using one method, then assign them to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.\n\n### Generate Your Scores\n\nChoose one generation method:\n\n**Standard Array** - Use these six scores: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8\n\n**Random Generation** - Roll four d6s and total the highest three. Repeat five more times for six numbers.\n\n**Point Cost** - You have 27 points to allocate using the Ability Score Point Costs table.\n\n#### Ability Score Point Costs\n\n| Score | Cost |\n|-------|------|\n| 8 | 0 |\n| 9 | 1 |\n| 10 | 2 |\n| 11 | 3 |\n| 12 | 4 |\n| 13 | 5 |\n| 14 | 7 |\n| 15 | 9 |\n\n### Assign Ability Scores\n\nDistribute your six scores among the abilities, prioritizing your class's primary ability.\n\n#### Standard Array by Class\n\n| Class | Str | Dex | Con | Int | Wis | Cha |\n|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Barbarian | 15 | 13 | 14 | 10 | 12 | 8 |\n| Bard | 8 | 14 | 12 | 13 | 10 | 15 |\n| Cleric | 14 | 8 | 13 | 10 | 15 | 12 |\n| Druid | 8 | 12 | 14 | 13 | 15 | 10 |\n| Fighter | 15 | 14 | 13 | 8 | 10 | 12 |\n| Monk | 12 | 15 | 13 | 10 | 14 | 8 |\n| Paladin | 15 | 10 | 13 | 8 | 12 | 14 |\n| Ranger | 12 | 15 | 13 | 8 | 14 | 10 |\n| Rogue | 12 | 15 | 13 | 14 | 10 | 8 |\n| Sorcerer | 10 | 13 | 14 | 8 | 12 | 15 |\n| Warlock | 8 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 10 | 15 |\n| Wizard | 8 | 12 | 13 | 15 | 14 | 10 |\n\n### Adjust Ability Scores\n\nYour background lists three abilities. Increase one by 2 and another by 1, OR increase all three by 1. No adjustment can raise a score above 20.\n\n### Determine Ability Modifiers\n\n| Score | Modifier |\n|-------|----------|\n| 3 | −4 |\n| 4–5 | −3 |\n| 6–7 | −2 |\n| 8–9 | −1 |\n| 10–11 | +0 |\n| 12–13 | +1 |\n| 14–15 | +2 |\n| 16–17 | +3 |\n| 18–19 | +4 |\n| 20 | +5 |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Alignment\n\nChoose your character's alignment. Player characters typically aren't evil—consult your GM before selecting an evil alignment.\n\n### The Nine Alignments\n\n**Lawful Good (LG)** - Characters doing what society considers right while protecting the innocent.\n\n**Neutral Good (NG)** - Characters helping others according to need while working within rules.\n\n**Chaotic Good (CG)** - Characters following conscience with little regard for expectations.\n\n**Lawful Neutral (LN)** - Characters adhering to law, tradition, or personal codes.\n\n**Neutral (N)** - Characters avoiding moral questions and doing what seems best momentarily.\n\n**Chaotic Neutral (CN)** - Characters valuing personal freedom above all else.\n\n**Lawful Evil (LE)** - Characters methodically taking what they want within codes of order.\n\n**Neutral Evil (NE)** - Characters unconcerned with harm while pursuing desires.\n\n**Chaotic Evil (CE)** - Characters acting with arbitrary violence driven by hatred.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Character Creation Details\n\n### Record Class Features\n\nWrite down all level 1 features from your class's feature table.\n\n### Fill In Numbers\n\n**Saving Throws** - For proficient saving throws, add your Proficiency Bonus to the relevant ability modifier.\n\n**Skills** - For proficient skills, add your Proficiency Bonus to the associated ability modifier.\n\n**Passive Perception** - Calculate using: 10 + Wisdom (Perception) check modifier.\n\n**Hit Points** - Consult the Level 1 Hit Points by Class table.\n\n#### Level 1 Hit Points by Class\n\n| Class | Hit Point Maximum |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| Barbarian | 12 + Con modifier |\n| Fighter, Paladin, Ranger | 10 + Con modifier |\n| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, Warlock | 8 + Con modifier |\n| Sorcerer, Wizard | 6 + Con modifier |\n\n**Hit Point Dice** - Write your class's Hit Die type.

    "description": "The fundamental structure of D&D gameplay revolves around three core pillars: social interaction, exploration, and combat. Regardless of which element is being experienced, play follows a consistent cycle:\n\n1. **The Game Master Describes a Scene.** The GM sets the stage by explaining the adventurers' location and surrounding details such as available exits, objects, and environmental features.\n\n2. **The Players Describe What Their Characters Do.** While characters typically travel together, they may pursue separate activities - one character might open a chest while another inspects a wall carving and a third watches for threats. The GM manages turn order outside combat and resolves actions, whereas combat uses a formal turn-based system.\n\n3. **The GM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers' Actions.** Simple tasks may resolve immediately, such as opening an unlocked door. However, obstacles like locked doors, traps, or other complications may require dice rolls to determine outcomes. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the game back to step 1.\n\nThis three-step cycle repeats throughout every session, whether characters are negotiating with nobility, investigating ruins, or engaging in combat. Combat situations employ more structured mechanics with sequential turns.\n\n## Exceptions Supersede General Rules\n\nGeneral rules provide the foundation for gameplay mechanics. However, specific features - class abilities, feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, and monster abilities - sometimes override these baseline rules. When conflicts arise, the specific exception takes precedence over the general rule."

The score represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability Scores table summarizes what the scores mean.\n\n### Ability Score Meanings\n\n| Score | Meaning |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1 | This is the lowest a score can normally go. If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect explains what happens. |\n| 2-9 | This represents a weak ability. |\n| 10-11 | This represents the human average. |\n| 12-19 | This represents a strong capability. |\n| 20 | This is the highest an adventurer's score can go unless a feature says otherwise. |\n| 21-29 | This represents an extraordinary capability. |\n| 30 | This is the highest a score can go. |\n\n## Ability Modifiers\n\nEach ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you make a D20 Test with that ability. An ability modifier is derived from its score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.\n\n**Round Down:** Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.\n\n### Ability Modifiers Table\n\n| Score | Modifier |\n|-------|----------|\n| 1 | -5 |\n| 2-3 | -4 |\n| 4-5 | -3 |\n| 6-7 | -2 |\n| 8-9 | -1 |\n| 10-11 | +0 |\n| 12-13 | +1 |\n| 14-15 | +2 |\n| 16-17 | +3 |\n| 18-19 | +4 |\n| 20-21 | +5 |\n| 22-23 | +6 |\n| 24-25 | +7 |\n| 26-27 | +8 |\n| 28-29 | +9 |\n| 30 | +10 |"

The degree to which they succeed relates to their Proficiency Bonus, which reflects training and increases with character level or monster Challenge Rating. This bonus applies to D20 Tests when the creature has proficiency in a skill, saving throw, or equipment used for that test. It also factors into spell attacks and spell save DCs.\n\n## Proficiency Bonus Table\n\n| Level or CR | Bonus |\n|-------------|-------|\n| Up to 4 | +2 |\n| 5-8 | +3 |\n| 9-12 | +4 |\n| 13-16 | +5 |\n| 17-20 | +6 |\n| 21-24 | +7 |\n| 25-28 | +8 |\n| 29-30 | +9 |\n\n## The Bonus Doesn't Stack\n\nYour Proficiency Bonus can't be added to a die roll or another number more than once. While the bonus may be multiplied or divided (such as through Expertise), it applies only once per roll.\n\n## Skill Proficiencies\n\nCreatures with skill proficiency add their Proficiency Bonus to related ability checks. Without proficiency, ability checks are still possible but lack this bonus.\n\n### Skill List\n\n| Skill | Ability | Example Uses |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| Acrobatics | Dexterity | Stay on your feet in tricky situations or perform acrobatic stunts |\n| Animal Handling | Wisdom | Calm, train, or direct animals |\n| Arcana | Intelligence | Recall lore about spells, magic items, and planes |\n| Athletics | Strength | Jump farther, stay afloat, or break objects |\n| Deception | Charisma | Tell convincing lies or wear disguises |\n| History | Intelligence | Recall lore about historical events and cultures |\n| Insight | Wisdom | Discern a person's mood and intentions |\n| Intimidation | Charisma | Awe or threaten someone |\n| Investigation | Intelligence | Find obscure information or deduce mechanics |\n| Medicine | Wisdom | Diagnose illness or determine cause of death |\n| Nature | Intelligence | Recall lore about terrain, plants, and weather |\n| Perception | Wisdom | Notice things easy to miss using senses |\n| Performance | Charisma | Act, tell stories, perform music, or dance |\n| Persuasion | Charisma | Convince someone honestly and graciously |\n| Religion | Intelligence | Recall lore about gods and rituals |\n| Sleight of Hand | Dexterity | Pick pockets or perform legerdemain |\n| Stealth | Dexterity | Move quietly and hide |\n| Survival | Wisdom | Follow tracks, forage, or avoid hazards |\n\n## Saving Throw Proficiencies\n\nProficiency in saving throws allows a character to add their Proficiency Bonus to saves using a particular ability. Each class grants proficiency in at least two saving throws, reflecting training in resisting specific threats.\n\n## Equipment Proficiencies\n\n**Weapons:** Proficiency allows you to add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon.\n\n**Tools:** Tool proficiency permits adding your Proficiency Bonus to relevant ability checks. If you're also proficient in the related skill, you gain Advantage on that check."

The Action table lists the game's main actions.\n\n## Action Table\n\n| Action | Summary |\n|--------|--------|\n| Attack | Attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike. |\n| Dash | For the rest of the turn, give yourself extra movement equal to your Speed. |\n| Disengage | Your movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the turn. |\n| Dodge | Until the start of your next turn, attack rolls against you have Disadvantage, and you make Dexterity saving throws with Advantage. You lose this benefit if you have the Incapacitated condition or if your Speed is 0. |\n| Help | Help another creature's ability check or attack roll, or administer first aid. |\n| Hide | Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. |\n| Influence | Make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to alter a creature's attitude. |\n| Magic | Cast a spell, use a magic item, or use a magical feature. |\n| Ready | Prepare to take an action in response to a trigger you define. |\n| Search | Make a Wisdom (Insight, Medicine, Perception, or Survival) check. |\n| Study | Make an Intelligence (Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion) check. |\n| Utilize | Use a nonmagical object. |\n\nPlayer characters and monsters can also do things not covered by these actions. Many class features and other abilities provide additional action options, and you can improvise other actions. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the Game Master tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to make, if any.\n\n## One Thing at a Time\n\nYou can take only one action at a time. This principle applies throughout gameplay, whether during combat or other situations. During social interactions, you might attempt to influence a creature or read body language, but not simultaneously. Similarly, while exploring, you cannot search for traps while helping another character open a stuck door.\n\n## Bonus Actions\n\nVarious class features, spells, and other abilities grant an additional action called a Bonus Action. You can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability, a spell, or another feature of the game states that you can do something as a Bonus Action.\n\nKey restrictions include taking only one Bonus Action per turn and choosing which to use if multiple options exist. The timing of Bonus Actions is at your discretion unless otherwise specified. Any condition that prevents standard actions also prevents Bonus Actions.\n\n## Reactions\n\nCertain abilities, spells, and situations enable a special action called a Reaction. A Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The Opportunity Attack represents the most common reaction type.\n\nOnce you take a Reaction, you cannot take another until the start of your subsequent turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature continues afterward."

    "category": "Social Interaction",
    "description": "During adventures, player characters encounter numerous NPCs and creatures preferring dialogue to combat. Social interactions take varied forms - convincing a burglar to confess or flattering a guard are examples. The Game Master portrays all nonplayer characters involved.\n\nAn NPC's disposition toward your character falls into three categories: Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile. Friendly NPCs are inclined to provide assistance, while Hostile ones tend to obstruct.\n\nSocial interactions unfold through two mechanisms: roleplaying and ability checks.\n\n## Roleplaying\n\nRoleplaying involves embodying your character's personality, determining their thoughts, actions, and speech. This core mechanic appears throughout the game but becomes especially prominent during social encounters.\n\nConsider whether you favor an active or descriptive approach when roleplaying.\n\nThe GM uses an NPC's established personality alongside your character's actions and attitudes to determine responses. A fearful bandit might surrender to imprisonment threats. A stubborn merchant refuses help if badgered. A conceited dragon enjoys flattery.\n\nDuring NPC interactions, observe the GM's characterization carefully. Understanding an NPC's objectives helps you influence their behavior effectively.\n\nOffering NPCs desired items or appealing to their sympathies, anxieties, or motivations can cultivate alliances, prevent conflict, or reveal crucial information. Conversely, insulting an honorable warrior or denigrating a nobleman's companions will probably undermine your persuasion or deception attempts.\n\n## Ability Checks\n\nAbility checks prove instrumental in determining social interaction outcomes. While roleplaying can shift an NPC's attitude, chance elements may factor in when the GM opts for dice-based resolution. The GM typically requests the Influence action in these scenarios.\n\nConsider your skill proficiencies when planning NPC interactions; employ approaches leveraging your group's strengths. For instance, when deceiving a guard, the Rogue with Deception proficiency should take the lead."

Spell slots are restored after a Long Rest (or Short Rest for some classes like Warlocks).\n\n## Casting Without Slots\n\n**Cantrips.** Level 0 spells can be cast at will without expending spell slots.\n\n**Rituals.** Spells with the Ritual tag can be cast in a ritual version that takes 10 minutes longer but doesn't expend a spell slot.\n\n**Special Abilities.** Some class features and feats allow you to cast certain spells without expending a slot, typically once per Long Rest.\n\n**Magic Items.** Spell Scrolls and other magic items may allow you to cast spells without using your own spell slots.\n\n## Using Higher-Level Spell Slots\n\nWhen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. Some spells have more powerful effects when cast at higher levels, as detailed in the spell's description.\n\n## One Spell Slot Per Turn\n\nOn a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast a spell. This means if you cast a spell as a Bonus Action, any other spell you cast on that turn must be a cantrip with a casting time of one action.\n\n## Casting Time\n\nMost spells require one action to cast using the Magic action. Some spells use a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or take 1 minute or longer.\n\n### Longer Casting Times\n\nSpells requiring 1 minute or longer demand the Magic action each turn and maintained Concentration. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails but you don't lose the spell slot.\n\n## Range\n\nSpells have ranges expressed as a distance in feet, Touch, or Self. Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by range unless the spell description says otherwise.\n\n## Schools of Magic\n\nEight schools categorize spells by their effect type:\n- **Abjuration:** Protective spells\n- **Conjuration:** Transporting objects and creatures\n- **Divination:** Revealing information\n- **Enchantment:** Affecting minds\n- **Evocation:** Channeling energy for damage or healing\n- **Illusion:** Deceiving the senses\n- **Necromancy:** Manipulating life force\n- **Transmutation:** Changing properties\n\n## Saving Throws and Attack Rolls\n\n**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus\n\n**Spell Attack Modifier** = your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus\n\n### Combining Magical Effects\n\nDifferent spells stack their effects. However, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine—only the most powerful or most recent effect applies."

    "description": "Spells may require Verbal (V), Somatic (S), or Material (M) components. Each spell's description lists which components are required.\n\n## Verbal (V)\n\nCasting a spell with a verbal component requires speaking mystic words. Being silenced or in an area of magical silence prevents casting spells with V components.\n\nThe words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion.\n\n## Somatic (S)\n\nCasting a spell with a somatic component requires hand gestures. You must have a free hand to make these gestures, or you can use the same hand holding your spellcasting focus.\n\nThe gestures might include forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of motions. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.\n\n## Material (M)\n\nCasting a spell with a material component requires specific items. These items are listed in parentheses in the Components entry of the spell.\n\n### Component Pouches and Focuses\n\nA Component Pouch or Spellcasting Focus can substitute for most material components. However, if a component has a listed cost or is consumed by the spell, you must have that specific component.\n\n**Component Pouch:** A small, watertight leather belt pouch containing all the material components needed for your spells, except those with a cost.\n\n**Spellcasting Focus:** An object—such as a crystal, orb, rod, staff, wand, or holy symbol—specially designed to channel the power of spells. A character can use such an object as described in the class features.\n\n### Consumed Components\n\nSome spells specify that their material components are consumed by the casting. You must provide these components fresh for each casting.\n\n### Costly Components\n\nIf a spell specifies a gold piece cost for a component, you must have components worth at least that much. A spellcasting focus or component pouch cannot replace such a component."

    "description": "Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour in pursuit of adventure. They need to rest—time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.\n\nAdventurers can take Short Rests in the midst of a day and a Long Rest to end it.\n\n## Short Rest\n\nA Short Rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\n\n### Using Hit Dice\n\nA character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a Short Rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which equals the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains Hit Points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.\n\n### Recovering Short Rest Abilities\n\nSome class features and other abilities recharge after a Short Rest. Consult those features for details.\n\n## Long Rest\n\nA Long Rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.\n\n### Benefits of a Long Rest\n\nAt the end of a Long Rest, a character regains all lost Hit Points and spent Hit Dice (up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them). In addition, the character's exhaustion level decreases by 1, and they regain all spent spell slots.\n\n### Long Rest Limitations\n\nA character can't benefit from more than one Long Rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 Hit Point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.\n\n### Interrupting a Long Rest\n\nIf a Long Rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it."

If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\n\n### Maintaining Concentration\n\nNormal activity—such as moving and attacking—doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\n\n**Casting another concentration spell.** You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration.\n\n**Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher.\n\n**Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration if you are incapacitated or if you die.\n\n**Environmental interference.** The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.\n\n### Ending Concentration\n\nYou can end concentration at any time (no action required).\n\n## Time Span\n\nSome spells last for a specific duration, such as 1 minute or 8 hours. The spell's magic persists for this duration unless:\n\n- The spell is dispelled\n- The spell specifies conditions that end it early\n- The caster dismisses it (if permitted by the spell)\n\nYou can dismiss a spell you cast if you are not Incapacitated and the spell doesn't require concentration.

A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect.\n\n## Targeting Requirements\n\nTo target something with a spell, you must have a clear path to it. If you place an area of effect at a point you can't see and an obstruction is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.\n\n### Line of Sight\n\nUnless a spell has a visible effect or the spell says otherwise, a creature doesn't know it is being targeted by a spell.\n\n### Targeting Yourself\n\nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you.\n\n### Invalid Targets\n\nIf a target is invalid (like targeting a creature immune to the spell's effect or a target behind total cover), the spell slot is expended but the spell has no effect on that target.\n\n## Areas of Effect\n\nSpells such as *burning hands* and *cone of cold* cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once. A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of six shapes:\n\n### Cone\n\nA cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin.

The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side.\n\n### Cylinder\n\nA cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder.\n\n### Emanation\n\nAn emanation extends in straight lines from a creature or object in all directions. Its size is determined by the radius from the creature or object at its center.\n\n### Line\n\nA line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.\n\n### Sphere\n\nYou select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point.

A curse that lasts for 1 minute equates to a level 3 spell, while one that lasts until dispelled equates to a level 9 spell.\n\n**Cursed Creatures.** Some monsters are associated with curses, whether as part of their origins or due to their ability to spread curses—werewolves being a prime example.\n\n**Cursed Magic Items.** Cursed magic items are created deliberately or originate as the result of supernatural events.\n\n**Narrative Curses.** A curse might manifest during an adventure when a creature's violation of a taboo warrants supernatural punishment, such as breaking a vow, defiling a tomb, or murdering an innocent.\n\n## Demonic Possession\n\nDemonic Possession arises from the chaos and evil of the Abyss and commonly besets creatures that interact with demonic objects or linger in desecrated locations. A creature that becomes the target of Demonic Possession must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by a bodiless demonic entity.
