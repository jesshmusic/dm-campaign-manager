    "description": "The three main pillars of D&D play are social interaction, exploration, and combat. Whichever one you're experiencing, the game unfolds according to this basic pattern:\n\n**1: The Game Master Describes a Scene.** The GM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, and so on).\n\n**2: The Players Describe What Their Characters Do.** Typically, the characters stick together as they travel through a dungeon or another environment. Sometimes different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines a mysterious symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the GM ensures that every character has a chance to act and decides how to resolve their activity. In combat, the characters take turns.\n\n**3: The GM Narrates the Results of the Adventurers' Actions.** Sometimes resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to open a door, the GM might say the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the GM might ask the player to roll a die to help determine what happens. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the game back to step 1.\n\nThis pattern holds during every game session (each time you sit down to play D&D), whether the adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or fighting a dragon. In certain situations\u2014particularly combat\u2014the action is more structured, and everyone takes turns. \n\n> ### Exceptions Supercede General Rules\n> General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee attacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn't explicitly say otherwise.\n>\n> The game also includes elements\u2014class features, feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like\u2014that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.",

If the roll has Advantage or Disadvantage, you roll two d20s, but you use the number from only one of them\u2014the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower one if you have Disadvantage.\n\n**2: Add Modifiers.** Add these modifiers to the number rolled on the d20:\n- **The Relevant Ability Modifier.** The rules explain which ability modifiers to use for various D20 Tests.\n- **Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant.** Each creature has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added when making a D20 Test that uses something in which the creature has proficiency.\n- **Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties.** A class feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus or penalty to the die roll.\n\n**3: Compare the Total to a Target Number.** If the total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or exceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).",

Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.\n- **Dim Light.** Dim Light, also called shadows, creates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light is usually a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as Dim Light.\n- **Darkness.** Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.",

The player tells the GM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever or opening a door, and the GM describes what happens.\n\n**What Is an Object?** For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone. It isn't a building or a vehicle, which are composed of many objects.\n\n**Time-Limited Object Interactions.** When time is short, such as in combat, interactions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That interaction must occur during a creature's movement or action. Any additional interactions require the Utilize action.\n\n**Finding Hidden Objects.** When your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided you describe the character searching in the hidden object's vicinity.\n\n**Carrying Objects.** You can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight. If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the GM might require you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity in \"Rules Glossary.\"\n\n**Breaking Objects.** As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to damage something more resilient, the GM might use the rules on breaking objects in \"Rules Glossary.\"",

The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative.

For example, if an ambusher starts combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware that combat is starting, that foe is surprised.\n\n**Initiative Order.** A combatant's check total is called their Initiative count, or Initiative for short. The GM ranks the combatants, from highest to lowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act during each round. The Initiative order remains the same from round to round.\n\n**Ties.** If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied monsters, and the players decide the order among tied characters.

Throughout this chapter, we use the term \"character sheet\" to mean whatever you use to track your character's details, whether it's a printed character sheet, a digital character sheet, or plain paper. Choose whichever style of sheet works for you, and then embark on creating a character!\n\n---\n\n## Create Your Character\n\nHere are the steps to make a character; each step is explored in detail:\n\n**1: Choose a Class.** Every adventurer is a member of a class. A class broadly describes a character's vocation, special talents, and favored tactics.\n\n**2: Determine Origin.** A character's origin includes two elements: background and species. How did the character spend the years leading up to a life of adventure? Who are the character's ancestors? You can also choose your character's languages.\n\n**3: Determine Ability Scores.** Much of what your character does in the game depends on the character's six abilities.\n\n**4: Choose an Alignment.** Alignment is a shorthand for your character's moral compass.\n\n**5: Fill in Details.** Using the choices you've made, fill in the remaining details on your character sheet.\n\n---",

    "name": "Step 2: Character Origin",
    "description": "Determining your character's origin involves choosing a background, a species, and two languages.\n\nA character's background represents the place and occupation that were most formative for the character. The combination of background, species, and languages provides fertile soil for your imagination as you ponder your character's earliest days.\n\n### Choose a Background\n\nChoose your character's background, and write it on your character sheet. You can choose any of the backgrounds detailed in \"Character Origins,\" and your GM might offer additional backgrounds as options.\n\nThe background you choose influences step 3, when you determine your character's ability scores. If you're having trouble choosing, the following table shows which backgrounds benefit which ability scores. Look for your class's primary ability there.\n\n| Ability | Background |\n|---------|------------|\n| Strength | Soldier |\n| Dexterity | Soldier |\n| Constitution | Soldier |\n| Intelligence | Acolyte |\n| Wisdom | Acolyte |\n| Charisma | Acolyte |\n\n**Record Your Feat.** A background gives you a feat, which grants your character particular capabilities. Feats are detailed in \"Feats.\" Write the feat on your character sheet.\n\n**Note Proficiencies.** Your background gives proficiency in two skills and with one tool. Record this information on your character sheet.\n\nYour class also gives proficiencies. Check your class description in \"Classes\" and note the proficiencies on your character sheet.\n\nThe features table in your class description shows your Proficiency Bonus (described in \"Playing the Game\"), which is +2 for a level 1 character. Note this number on your character sheet. You'll fill in other numbers connected to these proficiencies in step 5.\n\n### Choose Starting Equipment\n\nYour background and class both provide starting equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step can be immediately spent on equipment from \"Equipment.\"\n\nRecord your chosen equipment on your character sheet. Equipment is described in \"Equipment,\" but for now you can just write it all down and look up the specifics in \"Equipment\" later. Note any coins you have left after purchasing your equipment.\n\n### Choose a Species\n\nChoose a species for your character. The following species options are detailed in \"Character Origins\": Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling, Human, Orc, and Tiefling. Once you've chosen a species, write it on your character sheet. Then record your species' traits.\n\nYour character's size and Speed are determined by the character's species; record these in the appropriate places on your character sheet as well (you may write just the first letter of your size).\n\n### Imagine Your Past and Present\n\nLet your character's background and species inspire how you imagine their past. That past fed into the character's present. With that in mind, consider answers to the following questions as your character:\n\n- Who raised you?\n- Who was your dearest childhood friend?\n- Did you grow up with a pet?\n- Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?\n- Did you join an organization, such as a guild or religion? If so, are you still a member of it?\n- What elements of your past inspire you to go on adventures now?\n\n### Choose Languages\n\nYour character knows at least three languages: Common plus two languages you roll or choose from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a language means your character can communicate in it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features might also give you languages.\n\n**Standard Languages**\n\n| 1d12 | Language |\n|------|----------|\n| \u2014 | Common |\n| 1 | Common Sign Language |\n| 2 | Draconic |\n| 3\u20134 | Dwarvish |\n| 5\u20136 | Elvish |\n| 7 | Giant |\n| 8 | Gnomish |\n| 9 | Goblin |\n| 10\u201311 | Halfling |\n| 12 | Orc |\n\n**Rare Languages**\n\n| Language | Language |\n|----------|----------|\n| Abyssal | Primordial* |\n| Celestial | Sylvan |\n| Deep Speech | Thieves' Cant |\n| Druidic | Undercommon |\n| Infernal | |\n\n*Primordial includes the Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran dialects.

    "description": "To determine your character's ability scores, you first generate a set of six numbers using the instructions below and then assign them to your six abilities. \"Playing the Game\" explains what each ability means.\n\n### Generate Your Scores\n\nDetermine your ability scores by using one of the following three methods. Your GM might prefer you to use a particular one.\n\n**Standard Array.** Use the following six scores for your abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.\n\n**Random Generation.** Roll four d6s and record the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more times, so you have six numbers.\n\n**Point Cost.** You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Costs table.\n\n| Score | Cost | Score | Cost |\n|-------|------|-------|------|\n| 8 | 0 | 12 | 4 |\n| 9 | 1 | 13 | 5 |\n| 10 | 2 | 14 | 7 |\n| 11 | 3 | 15 | 9 |\n\n### Assign Ability Scores\n\nOnce you've generated six scores, assign them to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class's primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well.\n\nIf you're using the Standard Array option, consult the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions on where to assign scores for your character's class. The table puts the highest scores in a class's main abilities. If you used a different method to generate the scores, you may still use this table to guide where you place your highest and lowest scores.\n\n| Class | Str. | Dex. | Con. | Int. | Wis. | Cha. |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Barbarian | 15 | 13 | 14 | 10 | 12 | 8 |\n| Bard | 8 | 14 | 12 | 13 | 10 | 15 |\n| Cleric | 14 | 8 | 13 | 10 | 15 | 12 |\n| Druid | 8 | 12 | 14 | 13 | 15 | 10 |\n| Fighter | 15 | 14 | 13 | 8 | 10 | 12 |\n| Monk | 12 | 15 | 13 | 10 | 14 | 8 |\n| Paladin | 15 | 10 | 13 | 8 | 12 | 14 |\n| Ranger | 12 | 15 | 13 | 8 | 14 | 10 |\n| Rogue | 12 | 15 | 13 | 14 | 10 | 8 |\n| Sorcerer | 10 | 13 | 14 | 8 | 12 | 15 |\n| Warlock | 8 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 10 | 15 |\n| Wizard | 8 | 12 | 13 | 15 | 14 | 10 |\n\n### Adjust Ability Scores\n\nAfter assigning your ability scores, adjust them according to your background. Your background lists three abilities; increase one of those scores by 2 and a different one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of these increases can raise a score above 20.\n\nSome players like to increase their class's primary ability, while others prefer to increase a low score.\n\n### Determine Ability Modifiers\n\nFinally, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. Write the modifier next to each of your scores.\n\n| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |\n|-------|----------|-------|----------|\n| 3 | \u22124 | 12\u201313 | +1 |\n| 4\u20135 | \u22123 | 14\u201315 | +2 |\n| 6\u20137 | \u22122 | 16\u201317 | +3 |\n| 8\u20139 | \u22121 | 18\u201319 | +4 |\n| 10\u201311 | +0 | 20 | +5 |",

    "description": "Choose your character's alignment from the options below, and note it on your character sheet.\n\nThe game assumes that player characters aren't of an evil alignment. Check with your GM before making an evil character.\n\n### The Nine Alignments\n\nA creature's alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).\n\nThe summaries of the alignments below describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment; individuals can vary from that behavior.\n\n**Lawful Good (LG).** Lawful Good creatures endeavor to do the right thing as expected by society. Someone who fights injustice and protects the innocent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.\n\n**Neutral Good (NG).** Neutral Good creatures do the best they can, working within rules but not feeling bound by them. A kindly person who helps others according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.\n\n**Chaotic Good (CG).** Chaotic Good creatures act as their conscience directs with little regard for what others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron's tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the poor is probably Chaotic Good.\n\n**Lawful Neutral (LN).** Lawful Neutral individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of life\u2014and isn't swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil\u2014is probably Lawful Neutral.\n\n**Neutral (N).** Neutral is the alignment of those who prefer to avoid moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Someone who's bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.\n\n**Chaotic Neutral (CN).** Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.\n\n**Lawful Evil (LE).** Lawful Evil creatures methodically take what they want within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploiting citizens while scheming for power is probably Lawful Evil.\n\n**Neutral Evil (NE).** Neutral Evil is the alignment of those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.\n\n**Chaotic Evil (CE).** Chaotic Evil creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or bloodlust. A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance and havoc is probably Chaotic Evil.\n\n> **Unaligned Creatures**\n>\n> Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought don't have alignments; they are unaligned. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they aren't evil; they are unaligned.",

The class features are detailed there too.\n\nSome class features offer choices. Make sure to read all your features and make any offered choices.\n\n### Fill In Numbers\n\nNote these numbers on your character sheet.\n\n**Saving Throws.** For the saving throws you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the appropriate ability modifier and note the total. Some players also like to note the modifier for saving throws they're not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.\n\n**Skills.** For skills you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated with that skill, and note the total. You might also wish to note the modifier for skills you're not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.\n\n**Passive Perception.** Sometimes your GM will determine whether your character notices something without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check; the GM uses your Passive Perception instead. Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general awareness of your surroundings when you're not actively looking for something. Use this formula to determine your Passive Perception score:\n\n> Passive Perception = 10 + Wisdom (Perception) check modifier\n\nInclude all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom (Perception) checks. For example, if your character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Perception skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency).\n\n**Hit Points.** Your class and Constitution modifier determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1.\n\n| Class | Hit Point Maximum |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| Barbarian | 12 + Con. modifier |\n| Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger | 10 + Con. modifier |\n| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock | 8 + Con. modifier |\n| Sorcerer or Wizard | 6 + Con. modifier |\n\nThe character sheet includes room to note your current Hit Points when you take damage, as well as any Temporary Hit Points you might gain. There's also space to track Death Saving Throws.\n\n**Hit Point Dice.** Your class's description tells you the die type of your character's Hit Point Dice (or Hit Dice for short); write this on your character sheet. At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space to note how many Hit Dice you've spent.\n\n**Initiative.** Write your Dexterity modifier in the space for Initiative on your character sheet.\n\n**Armor Class.** Without armor or a shield, your base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If your starting equipment includes armor or a Shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in \"Equipment.\" A class feature might give you a different way to calculate your AC.\n\n**Attacks.** In the Weapons & Damage Cantrips section of the character sheet, write your starting weapons. The attack roll bonus for a weapon with which you have proficiency is one of the following unless a weapon's property says otherwise:\n\n> Melee attack bonus = Strength modifier + Proficiency Bonus\n>\n> Ranged attack bonus = Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus\n\nLook up the damage and properties of your weapons in \"Equipment.\" You add the same ability modifier you use for attacks with a weapon to your damage rolls with that weapon.\n\n**Spellcasting.** Note both the saving throw DC for your spells and the attack bonus for attacks you make with them, using these formulas:\n\n> Spell save DC = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus\n>\n> Spell attack bonus = spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus\n\nYour spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is determined by whatever feature gives you the ability to cast the spell.\n\n**Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells.** If your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, your class features table shows the number of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips you know, and how many spells you can prepare.

Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, follow the rules for that class.\n\n**Spells Prepared.** You determine what spells you can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example, you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as well as four Sorcerer cantrips).\n\nEach spell you prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell.\n\n**Cantrips.** If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, unless the spell says otherwise.\n\n**Spell Slots.** You determine your available spell slots by adding together the following:\n\n- All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard classes\n- Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and Ranger classes\n\nThen look up this total level in the Level column of the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.\n\nThis table might give you spell slots of a higher level than the spells you prepare. You can use those slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like Burning Hands, has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level, you can use the enhanced effect as normal.\n\n**Pact Magic.** If you have the Pact Magic feature from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature, you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic to cast spells you have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast Warlock spells you have prepared.\n\n**Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level**\n\n| Level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 2 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 2 | 3 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 3 | 4 | 2 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 4 | 4 | 3 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 6 | 4 | 3 | 3 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 7 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 8 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 9 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 10 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 11 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 12 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 13 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 14 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| 15 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | \u2014 |\n| 16 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | \u2014 |\n| 17 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 18 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 19 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 20 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |",

    "description": "The Weapons table in this section shows the game's main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:\n\n**Category.** Every weapon falls into a category: Simple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.\n\n**Melee or Ranged.** A weapon is classified as either Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.\n\n**Damage.** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.\n\n**Properties.** Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the \"Properties\" section.\n\n**Mastery.** Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the \"Mastery Properties\" section. To use that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.\n\n### Weapon Proficiency\n\nAnyone can wield a weapon, but you must have proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to an attack roll you make with it. A player character's features can provide weapon proficiencies. A monster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.\n\n### Properties\n\nHere are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.\n\n**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.\n\n**Finesse.** When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.\n\n**Heavy.** You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.\n\n**Light.** When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.\n\n**Loading.** You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\n\n**Range.** A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the long range.\n\n**Reach.** A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.\n\n**Thrown.** If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.\n\n**Two-Handed.** A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.\n\n**Versatile.** A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.\n\n> **Improvised Weapons**\n>\n> If you use an object\u2014such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle\u2014as a makeshift weapon, see \"Improvised Weapons\" in \"Rules Glossary.\" Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.\n\n### Mastery Properties\n\nEach weapon has a mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character. The properties are defined below.\n\n**Cleave.** If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon's damage, but don't add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.\n\n**Graze.** If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.\n\n**Nick.** When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action instead of as a Bonus Action.

    "description": "A mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry gear that would otherwise slow you down.\n\n### Mounts and Cargo\n\nAn animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, add their carrying capacities together.\n\n### Barding\n\nBarding is armor designed for a mount. Any type of armor on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the normal cost, and it weighs twice as much.\n\n### Saddles\n\nA saddle comes with a bit, a bridle, reins, and any other equipment needed to use the saddle. A Military Saddle gives Advantage on any ability check you make to remain mounted. An Exotic Saddle is required for riding an aquatic or a flying mount.\n\n### Mounts and Other Animals\n\n| Item | Carrying Capacity | Cost |\n|------|-------------------|------|\n| Camel | 450 lb. | 50 GP |\n| Elephant | 1,320 lb. | 200 GP |\n| Horse, Draft | 540 lb. | 50 GP |\n| Horse, Riding | 480 lb. | 75 GP |\n| Mastiff | 195 lb. | 25 GP |\n| Mule | 420 lb. | 8 GP |\n| Pony | 225 lb. | 30 GP |\n| Warhorse | 540 lb. | 400 GP |\n\n### Tack, Harness, and Drawn Vehicles\n\n| Item | Weight | Cost |\n|------|--------|------|\n| Carriage | 600 lb. | 100 GP |\n| Cart | 200 lb. | 15 GP |\n| Chariot | 100 lb. | 250 GP |\n| Feed per day | 10 lb. | 5 CP |\n| Saddle, Exotic | 40 lb. | 60 GP |\n| Saddle, Military | 30 lb. | 20 GP |\n| Saddle, Riding | 25 lb. | 10 GP |\n| Sled | 300 lb. | 20 GP |\n| Stabling per day | \u2014 | 5 SP |\n| Wagon | 400 lb. | 35 GP |\n\n### Large Vehicles\n\nThe Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table provides statistics for various types of large vehicles.\n\n**Speed.** A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships can't move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and weighs 100 pounds.\n\n**Crew.** A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a crew of skilled hirelings (see \"Hirelings\" later in \"Equipment\") to function. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of ship, as shown in the table.\n\n**Passengers.** The table lists the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate using hammocks. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.\n\n**Damage Threshold.** If a vehicle has a damage threshold (see \"Rules Glossary\"), it's noted in the table.\n\n**Ship Repair.** Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor. If the repairs are made in a location where supplies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.\n\n### Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles\n\n| Ship | Speed | Crew | Passengers | Cargo (Tons) | AC | HP | Damage Threshold | Cost |\n|------|-------|------|------------|--------------|----|----|------------------|------|\n| Airship | 8 mph | 10 | 20 | 1 | 13 | 300 | \u2014 | 40,000 GP |\n| Galley | 4 mph | 80 | \u2014 | 150 | 15 | 500 | 20 | 30,000 GP |\n| Keelboat | 1 mph | 1 | 6 | 1/2 | 15 | 100 | 10 | 3,000 GP |\n| Longship | 3 mph | 40 | 150 | 10 | 15 | 300 | 15 | 10,000 GP |\n| Rowboat | 1\u00bd mph | 1 | 3 | \u2014 | 11 | 50 | \u2014 | 50 GP |\n| Sailing Ship | 2 mph | 20 | 20 | 100 | 15 | 300 | 15 | 10,000 GP |\n| Warship | 2\u00bd mph | 60 | 60 | 200 | 15 | 500 | 20 | 25,000 GP |\n\n---",

    "name": "Magic Items",
    "description": "Adventures hold the promise\u2014but not a guarantee\u2014of finding magic items. Hundreds of magic items are detailed in \"Magic Items\" later in this document. Here's what you need to know about using magic items.\n\n### Identifying a Magic Item\n\nSome magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspicuously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learning a magic item's properties isn't automatic.\n\nThe Identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an item's properties. Alternatively, you can focus on one magic item during a Short Rest while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, you learn its properties and how to use them (but not any curse the item might bear).\n\nSometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched inside the band, or a feathered design might hint that it's a Ring of Feather Falling.\n\nWearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. In the specific case of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster what a potion does. Other items might require more experimentation. For example, if your character puts on a Ring of Swimming, the GM might say, \"Your movement feels strangely fluid.\" Perhaps you then dive into a river to see what happens. The GM would then say you swim unexpectedly well.\n\n### Attunement\n\nSome magic items require a creature to form a bond\u2014called Attunement\u2014with them before the creature can use an item's magical properties. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires Attunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the benefits of a normal Shield if you aren't attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.\n\n**Attune during a Short Rest.** Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short Rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same Short Rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon), meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the Attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the Short Rest, you're attuned to the magic item and can access its full magical capabilities.\n\n**No More Than Three Items.** You can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item first. Additionally, you can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, you can't attune to more than one Ring of Protection at a time.\n\n**Ending Attunement.** Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement by spending another Short Rest focused on the item unless the item is cursed.\n\n### Wearing and Wielding Items\n\nUsing a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head, and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned, a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.\n\nIn most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.\n\n**Multiple Items of the Same Kind.** You can't wear more than one of certain magic items. You can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, or one cloak. The GM might make exceptions.\n\n**Paired Items.** Items that come in pairs\u2014such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves\u2014impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a Boot of Striding and Springing on one foot and a Boot of Elvenkind on the other foot gains no benefit from either.\n\n---",

    "name": "Crafting",
    "description": "### Crafting Nonmagical Items\n\nTo craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw materials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If you meet the requirements, you make the item, and you can use it or sell it at its normal price.\n\n**Tools.** The \"Tools\" section of \"Equipment\" lists which tools are required to make certain items. The GM assigns required tools for items not listed there. You must use the required tool to make an item and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who helps you must also have proficiency with it.\n\n**Raw Materials.** To make an item, you need raw materials worth half its purchase cost (round down). For example, you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate Armor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The GM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available.\n\n**Time.** To determine how many days (working 8 hours a day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Crossbow, which sells for 50 GP. If an item requires multiple days, the days needn't be consecutive. Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.\n\n### Brewing Potions of Healing\n\nA character who has proficiency with the Herbalism Kit can create a Potion of Healing. Doing so requires using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the course of 1 day (8 hours of work).\n\n### Scribing Spell Scrolls\n\nA spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and create a Spell Scroll, using the rules below.\n\n**Time and Cost.** Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription, you must work for 8 hours.

You must also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes its Material components, they are consumed only when you complete the scroll. The scroll's spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.\n\n**Cantrips.** If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were your level.\n\n### Spell Scroll Costs\n\n| Spell Level | Time | Cost |\n|-------------|------|------|\n| Cantrip | 1 day | 15 GP |\n| 1 | 1 day | 25 GP |\n| 2 | 3 days | 100 GP |\n| 3 | 5 days | 150 GP |\n| 4 | 10 days | 1,000 GP |\n| 5 | 25 days | 1,500 GP |\n| 6 | 40 days | 10,000 GP |\n| 7 | 50 days | 12,500 GP |\n| 8 | 60 days | 15,000 GP |\n| 9 | 120 days | 50,000 GP |",

    "description": "Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indicated in a spell's description. A spell's level is an indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips\u2014simple spells that can be cast almost by rote\u2014are level 0. The rules for each spellcasting class say when its members gain access to spells of certain levels.\n\n**Spell Slots.** Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster's magical potential is represented. Each spellcasting class gives its members a limited number of spell slots of certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.\n\nWhen you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively \"filling\" a slot with the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain size\u2014small for a level 1 slot and larger for a higher-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that's at least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts Magic Missile, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of four level 1 slots and has three remaining.\n\nFinishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell slots.\n\n**Casting without Slots.** There are several ways to cast a spell without expending a spell slot:\n\n- **Cantrips.** A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.\n- **Rituals.** Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it doesn't expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Ritual, a spellcaster must have it prepared.\n- **Special Abilities.** Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day.\n- **Magic Items.** Spell Scrolls and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a spell slot. The description of such an item specifies how many times a spell can be cast from it.\n\n**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a Wizard casts Magic Missile using a level 2 slot, that Magic Missile is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\n\nSome spells, such as Magic Missile and Cure Wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.",

Some spells that have a casting time of a Bonus Action are also cast in response to a trigger defined in the spell.\n\n**Longer Casting Times.** Certain spells\u2014including a spell cast as a Ritual\u2014require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. While you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 minute or more, you must take the Magic action on each of your turns, and you must maintain Concentration (see \"Rules Glossary\") while you do so.

The words must be uttered in a normal speaking voice. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is gagged or in an area of magical silence can't cast a spell with a Verbal component.\n\n**Somatic (S).** A Somatic component is a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. A spellcaster must use at least one of their hands to perform these movements.\n\n**Material (M).** A Material component is a particular material used in a spell's casting, as specified in parentheses in the Components entry. These materials aren't consumed by the spell unless the spell's description states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand free to access them, but it can be the same hand used to perform Somatic components, if any.\n\nIf a spell doesn't consume its materials and doesn't specify a cost for them, a spellcaster can use a Component Pouch (see \"Equipment\") instead of providing the materials specified in the spell, or the spellcaster can substitute a Spellcasting Focus if the caster has a feature that allows that substitution. To use a Component Pouch, you must have a hand free to reach into it, and to use a Spellcasting Focus, you must hold it unless its description says otherwise (see \"Equipment\" for descriptions).",

    "description": "The effects of a spell are detailed after its duration entry. Those details present exactly what the spell does, which ignores mundane physical laws; any outcomes beyond those effects are under the GM's purview. Whatever the effects, they typically deal with targets, saving throws, attack rolls, or all three, each of which is detailed below.\n\n**Targets.** A typical spell requires the caster to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description says whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or something else.\n\n- ***A Clear Path to the Target.*** To target something with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind Total Cover.\n- ***Targeting Yourself.*** If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature other than you.\n- ***Areas of Effect.*** Some spells, such as Thunderwave, cover an area called an area of effect, which is defined in \"Rules Glossary.\" The area determines what the spell targets. The description of a spell specifies whether it has an area of effect, which is typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Emanation, Line, or Sphere.\n- ***Awareness of Being Targeted.*** Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature doesn't know it was targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell's description says otherwise.\n- ***Invalid Targets.*** If you cast a spell on someone or something that can't be affected by it, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended. If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.\n\n**Saving Throws.** Many spells specify that a target makes a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure. Here's how to calculate the DC for your spells:\n\n> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus\n\n**Attack Rolls.** Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell hits a target. Here's how to calculate the attack modifier for your spells:\n\n> **Spell attack modifier** = your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus\n\n**Combining Spell Effects.** The effects of different spells add together while their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine. Instead, the most potent effect\u2014such as the highest bonus\u2014from those castings applies while their durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast Bless on the same target, that target gains the spell's benefit only once; the target doesn't receive two bonus dice. But if the durations of the spells overlap, the effect continues until the duration of the second Bless ends.\n\n> **Identifying an Ongoing Spell**\n>\n> You can try to identify a non-instantaneous spell by its observable effects if its duration is ongoing. To identify it, you must take the Study action and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.",
