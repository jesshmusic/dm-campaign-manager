      "When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of crea- tures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage, and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shat- ters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command word to deactivate it. Any creature other than you that sees its reflec- tion in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror\u2019s twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror\u2019s nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically. An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror\u2019s cells don\u2019t age, and they don\u2019t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed. If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve ex- tradimensional cells are already occupied, the mir- ror frees one trapped creature at random to accom- modate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in un- occupied spaces near it. While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror\u2019s surface. You and the creature can then communicate. In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror.
