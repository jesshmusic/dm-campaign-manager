Playing the Game

Rhythm of Play
The three main pillars of D&D play are social in-
teraction, exploration, and combat. Whichever one
you’re experiencing, the game unfolds according to
this basic pattern:

1:	The Game Master Describes a Scene. The GM
tells the players where their adventurers are and
what’s around them (how many doors lead out of
a room, what’s on a table, and so on).
2:	The Players Describe What Their Characters
Do. Typically, the characters stick together as
they travel through a dungeon or another envi-
ronment. Sometimes different adventurers do
different things: one adventurer might search a
treasure chest while a second examines a mys-
terious symbol engraved on a wall and a third
keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the
GM ensures that every character has a chance to
act and decides how to resolve their activity. In
combat, the characters take turns.
3:	The GM Narrates the Results of the Adventur-
ers’ Actions. Sometimes resolving a task is easy.
If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to
open a door, the GM might say the door opens and
describe what lies beyond. But the door might be
locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other
circumstance might make it challenging for an
adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the
GM might ask the player to roll a die to help de-
termine what happens. Describing the results of-
ten leads to another decision point, which brings
the game back to step 1.

This pattern holds during every game session
(each time you sit down to play D&D), whether the

Exceptions Supersede General Rules

General rules govern each part of the game. For
example, the combat rules tell you that melee at-
tacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity.
That’s a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as
long as something in the game doesn’t explicitly say
otherwise.
The game also includes elements—class features,
feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, mon-
ster abilities, and the like—that sometimes contra-
dict a general rule. When an exception and a general
rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a
feature says you can make melee attacks using your
Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement
disagrees with the general rule.

adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin,
or fighting a dragon. In certain situations—partic-
ularly combat—the action is more structured, and
everyone takes turns.
The Six Abilities
All creatures—characters and monsters—have six
abilities that measure physical and mental charac-
teristics, as shown on the Ability Descriptions table.

Ability Descriptions

Ability
Score Measures …

Strength
Physical might

Dexterity
Agility, reflexes, and balance

Constitution
Health and stamina

Intelligence
Reasoning and memory

Wisdom
Perceptiveness and mental fortitude

Charisma
Confidence, poise, and charm

Ability Scores

Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some
monsters have a score as high as 30. The score
represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability
Scores table summarizes what the scores mean.

Ability Scores

Score
Meaning

1
This is the lowest a score can normally go.
If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect
explains what happens.

2–9
This represents a weak capability.

10–11
This represents the human average.

12–19
This represents a strong capability.

20
This is the highest an adventurer’s score can
go unless a feature says otherwise.

21–29
This represents an extraordinary capability.

30
This is the highest a score can go.

Ability Modifiers

Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever
you make a D20 Test with that ability (explained in
“D20 Tests”). An ability modifier is derived from its
score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.

Round Down

Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the
game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even
if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make
an exception and tell you to round up.

D20 Tests
When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the
game uses a d20 roll to determine success or fail-
ure. These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come
in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and
attack rolls. They follow these steps:

4:	Roll 1d20. You always want to roll high. If the
roll has Advantage or Disadvantage (described
later in “Playing the Game”), you roll two d20s,
but you use the number from only one of them—
the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower
one if you have Disadvantage.
5:	Add Modifiers. Add these modifiers to the num-
ber rolled on the d20:

•	 The Relevant Ability Modifier. “Playing the
Game” and “Rules Glossary” explain which ability
modifiers to use for various D20 Tests.
•	 Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant. Each crea-
ture has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added
when making a D20 Test that uses something,
such as a skill, in which the creature has pro-
ficiency. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the
Game.”
•	 Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties. A class
feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus
or penalty to the die roll.

6:	Compare the Total to a Target Number. If the
total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or ex-
ceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds.
Otherwise, it fails. The Game Master determines
target numbers and tells players whether their
rolls are successful. The target number for an
ability check or a saving throw is called a Diffi-
culty Class (DC). The target number for an attack
roll is called an Armor Class (AC), which appears
on a character sheet or in a stat block (see “Rules
Glossary”).

Ability Checks

An ability check represents a creature using talent
and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as
forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertain-
ing a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The GM and the
rules often call for an ability check when a creature
attempts something other than an attack that has a
chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is
uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice de-
termine the result.

Ability Modifier
An ability check is named for the ability modifier it
uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so
on. Different ability checks are called for in differ-
ent situations, depending on which ability is most
relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for
examples of each check’s use.

Ability Check Examples

Ability
Make a Check To …

Strength
Lift, push, pull, or break something

Dexterity
Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly

Constitution
Push your body beyond normal limits

Intelligence
Reason or remember

Wisdom
Notice things in the environment or in
creatures’ behavior

Charisma
Influence, entertain, or deceive

Proficiency Bonus
Add your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check
when the GM determines that a skill or tool pro-
ficiency is relevant to the check and you have
that proficiency. For example, if a rule refers to a
Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can
add your Proficiency Bonus to the check if you have
proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See
“Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for more
information about skill and tool proficiencies.

Difficulty Class
The Difficulty Class of an ability check represents
the task’s difficulty. The more difficult the task,
the higher its DC. The rules provide DCs for certain
checks, but the GM ultimately sets them. The Typi-
cal Difficulty Classes table presents a range of pos-
sible DCs for ability checks.

Typical Difficulty Classes

Saving Throws

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an
attempt to evade or resist a threat, such as a fiery
explosion, a blast of poisonous gas, or a spell trying
to invade your mind. You don’t normally choose to
make a save; you must make one because your char-
acter or a monster (if you’re the GM) is at risk. A
save’s result is detailed in the effect that caused it.
If you don’t want to resist the effect, you can
choose to fail the save without rolling.

Ability Modifier
Saving throws are named for the ability modifiers
they use: a Constitution saving throw, a Wisdom
saving throw, and so on. Different saving throws are
used to resist different kinds of effects, as shown on
the Saving Throw Examples table.

Saving Throw Examples

Ability
Make a Save To …

Strength
Physically resist direct force

Dexterity
Dodge out of harm’s way

Constitution
Endure a toxic hazard

Intelligence
Recognize an illusion as fake

Wisdom
Resist a mental assault

Charisma
Assert your identity

Proficiency Bonus
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your saving
throw if you have proficiency in that kind of save.
See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game.”

Difficulty Class
The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is deter-
mined by the effect that causes it or by the GM. For
example, if a spell forces you to make a save, the DC
is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability
and Proficiency Bonus. Monster abilities that call
for saves specify the DC.
Attack Rolls

An attack roll determines whether an attack hits
a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or
exceeds the target’s Armor Class. Attack rolls usu-
ally occur in battle, described in “Combat” later in
“Playing the Game,” but the GM might also ask for
an attack roll in other situations, such as an archery
competition.

Ability Modifier
The Attack Roll Abilities table shows which ability
modifier to use for different types of attack rolls.

Attack Roll Abilities

Ability
Attack Type

Strength
Melee attack with a weapon or an Un-
armed Strike (see “Rules Glossary”)

Dexterity
Ranged attack with a weapon

Varies
Spell attack (the ability used is determined
by the spellcaster’s spellcasting feature, as
explained in “Spells”)

Some features let you use different ability modifiers
from those listed. For example, the Finesse property
(see “Equipment”) lets you use Strength or Dexter-
ity with a weapon that has that property.

Proficiency Bonus
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your attack roll
when you attack using a weapon you have profi-
ciency with, as well as when you attack with a spell.
See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for
more information about weapon proficiencies.

Armor Class
A creature’s Armor Class represents how well the
creature avoids being wounded in combat. The AC
of a character is determined at character creation
(see “Character Creation”), whereas the AC of a
monster appears in its stat block.
Calculating AC. All creatures start with the same
base AC calculation:

Base AC = 10 + the creature’s Dexterity modifier

A creature’s AC can then be modified by armor,
magic items, spells, and more.
Only One Base AC. Some spells and class features
give characters a different way to calculate their AC.
A character with multiple features that give differ-
ent ways to calculate AC must choose which one to
use; only one base calculation can be in effect for a
creature.

Rolling 20 or 1
If you roll a 20 on the d20 (called a “natural 20”) for
an attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any mod-
ifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a Critical Hit
(see “Combat” later in “Playing the Game”).
If you roll a 1 on the d20 (a “natural 1”) for an at-
tack roll, the attack misses regardless of any modifi-
ers or the target’s AC.
Advantage/Disadvantage

Sometimes a D20 Test is modified by Advantage or
Disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive cir-
cumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while Disadvan-
tage reflects negative circumstances.
You usually acquire Advantage or Disadvantage
through the use of special abilities and actions. The

Heroic Inspiration

Sometimes the GM or a rule gives you Heroic Inspira-
tion. If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it
to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you
must use the new roll.
Only One at a Time. You can never have more
than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something
gives you Heroic Inspiration and you already have it,
you can give it to a player character in your group
who lacks it.
Gaining Heroic Inspiration. Your GM can
give you Heroic Inspiration for a variety of reasons.
Typically, GMs award it when you do something par-
ticularly heroic, in character, or entertaining. It’s a
reward for making the game more fun for everyone
playing.
Other rules might allow your character to gain
Heroic Inspiration independent of the GM’s decision.
For example, Human characters start each day with
Heroic Inspiration.

GM can also decide that circumstances grant Ad-
vantage or impose Disadvantage.

Roll Two D20s
When a roll has either Advantage or Disadvantage,
roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the
higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and
use the lower roll if you have Disadvantage. For ex-
ample, if you have Disadvantage and roll an 18 and a
3, use the 3. If you instead have Advantage and roll
those numbers, use the 18.

They Don’t Stack
If multiple situations affect a roll and they all grant
Advantage on it, you still roll only two d20s. Simi-
larly, if multiple situations impose Disadvantage on
a roll, you roll only two d20s.
If circumstances cause a roll to have both Advan-
tage and Disadvantage, the roll has neither of them,
and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple
circumstances impose Disadvantage and only one
grants Advantage or vice versa. In such a situation,
you have neither Advantage nor Disadvantage.

Interactions with Rerolls
When you have Advantage or Disadvantage and
something in the game lets you reroll or replace the
d20, you can reroll or replace only one die, not both.
You choose which one.
For example, if you have Heroic Inspiration (see
the sidebar below) and roll a 3 and an 18 on an abil-
ity check that has Advantage or Disadvantage, you
could expend your Heroic Inspiration to reroll one
of those dice, not both of them.

Proficiency
Characters and monsters are good at various
things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while
others can use only a few. Some are better at under-
standing people’s motives, and others are better at
unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All crea-
tures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the
impact that training has on the creature’s capabil-
ities. A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as
the character gains levels (described in “Character
Creation”). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based
on its Challenge Rating (see “Rules Glossary”). The
Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is
determined.
This bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the crea-
ture has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or
with an item that the creature uses to make the D20
Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for
calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.

The Bonus Doesn’t Stack

Your Proficiency Bonus can’t be added to a die roll
or another number more than once. For example, if
a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or
Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus
if you’re proficient in either skill, but you don’t add
it twice if you’re proficient in both skills.
Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be mul-
tiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example)
before being added. For example, the Expertise
feature (see “Rules Glossary”) doubles the Profi-
ciency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever
the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and
divided only once.
Skill Proficiencies

Most ability checks involve using a skill, which rep-
resents a category of things creatures try to do with
an ability check. The descriptions of the actions
you take (see “Actions” later in “Playing the Game”)
specify which skill applies if you make an ability
check for that action, and many other rules note
when a skill is relevant. The GM has the ultimate say
on whether a skill is relevant in a situation.
If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature
applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks in-
volving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a
creature can still make ability checks involving

example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the GM
might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the
character has Athletics proficiency, the character
adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check.
If the character lacks that proficiency, they make
the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.

Skill List
The skills are shown on the Skills table, which notes
example uses for each skill proficiency as well as
the ability check the skill most often applies to.

Determining Skills
A character’s starting skill proficiencies are deter-
mined at character creation, and a monster’s skill
proficiencies appear in its stat block.
Saving Throw Proficiencies

Proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add
their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a partic-
ular ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom
saves lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to your
Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving
throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.
Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving
throws, representing that class’s training in evading
or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example,
are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves;
they train to resist mental assault.

Equipment Proficiencies

A character gains proficiency with various weapons
and tools from their class and background. There
are two categories of equipment proficiency:

Weapons. Anyone can wield a weapon, but profi-
ciency makes you better at wielding it. If you have
proficiency with a weapon, you add your Profi-
ciency Bonus to attack rolls you make with it.
Tools. If you have proficiency with a tool, you can
add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check
you make that uses the tool. If you have profi-
ciency in the skill that’s also used with that check,
you have Advantage on the check too. This means
you can benefit from both skill proficiency and
tool proficiency on the same ability check.
Actions
When you do something other than moving or com-
municating, you typically take an action. The Action
table lists the game’s main actions, which are de-
fined in more detail in “Rules Glossary.”

Actions

Your movement doesn’t provoke Oppor-
tunity Attacks for the rest of the turn.

Dodge
Until the start of your next turn, attack
rolls against you have Disadvantage, and
you make Dexterity saving throws with
Advantage. You lose this benefit if you
have the Incapacitated condition or if your
Speed is 0.

Help
Help another creature’s ability check or
attack roll, or administer first aid.

Hide
Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.

Influence
Make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation,
Performance, or Persuasion) or Wisdom
(Animal Handling) check to alter a crea-
ture’s attitude.

trigger you define.

Search
Make a Wisdom (Insight, Medicine,
Perception, or Survival) check.

Study
Make an Intelligence (Arcana, History, In-
vestigation, Nature, or Religion) check.

Utilize
Use a nonmagical object.

Player characters and monsters can also do things
not covered by these actions. Many class features
and other abilities provide additional action op-
tions, and you can improvise other actions. When
you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the
rules, the Game Master tells you whether that action
is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to
make, if any.
One Thing at a Time

The game uses actions to govern how much you can
do at one time. You can take only one action at a
time. This principle is most important in combat, as
explained in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”
Actions can come up in other situations, too: in a
social interaction, you can try to Influence a crea-
ture or use the Search action to read the creature’s
body language, but you can’t do both at the same
time. And when you’re exploring a dungeon, you
can’t simultaneously use the Search action to look
for traps and use the Help action to aid another
character who’s trying to open a stuck door (with
the Utilize action).
Bonus Actions

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let
you take an additional action on your turn called
a Bonus Action. The Cunning Action feature, for

example, allows a Rogue to take a Bonus Action. You
can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability,
a spell, or another feature of the game states that
you can do something as a Bonus Action. You other-
wise don’t have a Bonus Action to take.
You can take only one Bonus Action on your turn,
so you must choose which Bonus Action to use if you
have more than one available.
You choose when to take a Bonus Action during
your turn unless the Bonus Action’s timing is spec-
ified. Anything that deprives you of your ability to
take actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus
Action.
Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations al-
low you to take a special action called a Reaction. A
Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some
kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone
else’s. The Opportunity Attack, described later in
“Playing the Game,” is the most common type of
Reaction.
When you take a Reaction, you can’t take another
one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction
interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature
can continue its turn right after the Reaction.
In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immedi-
ately after its trigger unless the Reaction’s descrip-
tion says otherwise.
Social Interaction
During their adventures, player characters meet
many different people and face some monsters that
would rather talk than fight. In those situations, it’s
time for social interaction, which takes many forms.
For example, you might try to convince a burglar to
confess to wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard. The
Game Master assumes the roles of any nonplayer
characters who are participating.
An NPC’s attitude toward your character is
Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile, as defined in “Rules
Glossary.” Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help,
and Hostile ones are inclined to hinder.
Social interactions progress in two ways: through
roleplaying and ability checks.
Roleplaying

Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role.
In this case, it’s you as a player determining how
your character thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is
part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the
fore during social interactions.
As you roleplay, consider whether you prefer an
active approach or a descriptive approach.
The GM uses an NPC’s personality and your char-
acter’s actions and attitudes to determine how an

---

NPC reacts. A cowardly bandit might buckle under
threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant
refuses to help if the characters badger her. A vain
dragon laps up flattery.
When interacting with an NPC, pay attention to
the GM’s portrayal of the NPC’s personality. You
might be able to learn an NPC’s goals and then use
that information to influence the NPC.
If you offer NPCs something they want or play
on their sympathies, fears, or goals, you can form
friendships, ward off violence, or learn a key piece
of information. On the other hand, if you insult a
proud warrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your
efforts to convince or deceive will likely fail.
Ability Checks

Ability checks can be key in determining the out-
come of a social interaction. Your roleplaying efforts
can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be
an element of chance if the GM wants dice to play
a role in determining an NPC’s response to you. In
such situations, the GM will typically ask you to
take the Influence action.
Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when
thinking of how you will interact with an NPC; use
an approach that relies on your group’s skill pro-
ficiencies. For example, if the group needs to trick
a guard into letting them into a castle, the Rogue
who is proficient in Deception should lead the
discussion.
Exploration
Exploration involves delving into places that are
dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this sec-
tion detail some of the ways adventurers interact
with the environment in such places.
Adventuring Equipment

As adventurers explore, their equipment can help
them in many ways. For example, they can reach
out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things
they wouldn’t otherwise notice with a Torch or
another light source, bypass locked doors and con-
tainers with Thieves’ Tools, and create obstacles for
pursuers with Caltrops.
See “Equipment” for rules on many items that are
useful on adventures. The items in the“Tools” and
“Adventuring Gear” sections are especially useful.
The weapons in “Equipment” can also be used for
more than battle; you could use a Quarterstaff,
for example, to push a sinister-looking button that
you’re reluctant to touch.

Vision and Light

Some adventuring tasks—such as noticing danger,
hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells—are
affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can
hinder you, as explained below.

Obscured Areas
An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a
Lightly Obscured area—such as an area with Dim
Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage—you have
Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that
rely on sight.
A Heavily Obscured area—such as an area with
Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage—is opaque.
You have the Blinded condition (see “Rules Glos-
sary”) when trying to see something there.

Light
The presence or absence of light determines the cat-
egory of illumination in an area, as defined below.
Bright Light. Bright Light lets most creatures see
normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as
do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illu-
mination within a specific radius.
Dim Light. Dim Light, also called shadows, cre-
ates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light
is usually a boundary between Bright Light and
surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and
dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might
bathe the land in Dim Light.
Darkness. Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured
area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night
(even most moonlit nights), within the confines of
an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.

Special Senses
Some creatures have special senses that help them
perceive things in certain situations. “Rules Glos-
sary” defines the following special senses:

Blindsight
Darkvision
Tremorsense
Truesight
Hiding

Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to
spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an
ambush. The Game Master decides when circum-
stances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to
hide, you take the Hide action.
Interacting with Objects

Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve.
The player tells the GM that their character is do-
ing something, such as moving a lever or opening

times, however, rules govern what you can do with
an object, as detailed in the following sections.

What Is an Object?
For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete,
inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book,
table, chair, or stone. It isn’t a building or a vehicle,
which are composed of many objects.

Time-Limited Object Interactions
When time is short, such as in combat, interactions
with objects are limited: one free interaction per
turn. That interaction must occur during a crea-
ture’s movement or action. Any additional inter-
actions require the Utilize action, as explained in
“Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”

Finding Hidden Objects
When your character searches for hidden things,
such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks
you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided
you describe the character searching in the hidden
object’s vicinity. On a success, you find the object,
other important details, or both.
If you describe your character searching nowhere
near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check
won’t reveal the object, no matter the check’s total.

Carrying Objects
You can usually carry your gear and treasure with-
out worrying about the weight of those objects. If
you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a mas-
sive number of lighter objects, the GM might require
you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity in
“Rules Glossary.”

Breaking Objects
As an action, you can automatically break or oth-
erwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such
as a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to
damage something more resilient, the GM might use
the rules on breaking objects in “Rules Glossary.”

Marching Order

The adventurers should establish a marching order
while they travel, whether indoors or outdoors. A
marching order makes it easier to determine which
characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot
hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to
those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change
your marching order outside combat and record the
order any way you like: write it down, for example,
or arrange miniatures to show it.

Hazards

Monsters are the main perils characters face, but
other dangers await. “Rules Glossary” defines the
following hazards:

Burning
Dehydration
Falling
Malnutrition
Suffocation

Travel

During an adventure, the characters might travel
long distances on trips that could take hours or
days. The GM can summarize this travel without
calculating exact distances or travel times, or the
GM might have you use the travel pace rules below.
If you need to know how fast you can move when
every second matters, see the movement rules in
“Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”

Travel Pace
While traveling outside combat, a group can move
at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the
Travel Pace table. The table states how far the
party can move in a period of time; if riding horses
or other mounts, the group can move twice that
distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a
Short or Long Rest before they can move at that in-
creased pace again (see “Equipment” for a selection
of mounts for sale). “Gameplay Toolbox” has rules
that affect which pace you can choose in certain
types of terrain.

Travel Pace

Each travel pace has a game effect, as defined below.
Fast. Traveling at a Fast pace imposes Disadvan-
tage on a traveler’s Wisdom (Perception or Sur-
vival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Normal. Traveling at a Normal pace imposes Dis-
advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Slow. Traveling at a Slow pace grants Advantage
on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks.

Vehicles
Travelers in wagons, carriages, or other land vehi-
cles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a water-
borne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel,
and they don’t choose a travel pace. Depending on
the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be
able to travel for up to 24 hours per day. “Equip-
ment” includes vehicles for sale.

Combat
Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters
and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat
often breaks out.
The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two
sides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries,
footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes
combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round
represents about 6 seconds in the game world.
During a round, each participant in a battle takes a
turn. The order of turns is determined at the begin-
ning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once
everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the
next round if neither side is defeated.

Combat Step by Step
Combat unfolds in these steps:

1:	Establish Positions. The Game Master deter-
mines where all the characters and monsters are
located. Given the adventurers’ marching order
or their stated positions in the room or other lo-
cation, the GM figures out where the adversaries
are—how far away and in what direction.
2:	Roll Initiative. Everyone involved in the combat
encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order
of combatants’ turns.
3:	Take Turns. Each participant in the battle takes
a turn in Initiative order. When everyone in-
volved in the combat has had a turn, the round
ends. Repeat this step until the fighting stops.

Initiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during
combat. When combat starts, every participant
rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check that
determines their place in the Initiative order. The
GM rolls for monsters. For a group of identical crea-
tures, the GM makes a single roll, so each member of
the group has the same Initiative.
Surprise. If a combatant is surprised by combat
starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their
Initiative roll. For example, if an ambusher starts
combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware
that combat is starting, that foe is surprised.
Initiative Order. A combatant’s check total is
called their Initiative count, or Initiative for short.
The GM ranks the combatants, from highest to
lowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act
during each round. The Initiative order remains the
same from round to round.
Ties. If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order
among tied monsters, and the players decide the
order among tied characters. The GM decides the

order if the tie is between a monster and a player
character.

Your Turn
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your
Speed and take one action. You decide whether to
move first or take your action first.
The main actions you can take are listed in “Ac-
tions” earlier in “Playing the Game.” A character’s
features and a monster’s stat block also provide
action options. “Movement and Position” later in
“Playing the Game” gives the rules for movement.
Communicating. You can communicate however
you are able—through brief utterances and ges-
tures—as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither
your action nor your move.
Extended communication, such as a detailed ex-
planation of something or an attempt to persuade a
foe, requires an action. The Influence action is the
main way you try to influence a monster.
Interacting with Things. You can interact with
one object or feature of the environment for free,
during either your move or action. For example, you
could open a door during your move as you stride
toward a foe.
If you want to interact with a second object, you
need to take the Utilize action. Some magic items
and other special objects always require an action
to use, as stated in their descriptions.

Playing on a Grid

If you play using a square grid and miniatures or
other tokens, follow these rules.
Squares. Each square represents 5 feet.
Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move
square by square on the grid, using your Speed in
5-foot segments. You can translate your Speed into
squares by dividing it by 5. For example, a Speed of
30 feet translates into 6 squares. If you use a grid of-
ten, consider writing your Speed in squares on your
character sheet.
Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must
have enough movement left to pay for entering. It
costs 1 square of movement to enter an unoccupied
square that’s adjacent to your space (orthogonally
or diagonally adjacent). A square of Difficult Terrain
costs 2 squares to enter. Other effects might make a
square cost even more.
Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the cor-
ner of a wall, a large tree, or another terrain feature
that fills its space.
Ranges. To determine the range on a grid be-
tween two things—whether creatures or objects—
count squares from a square adjacent to one of them
and stop counting in the space of the other one.
Count by the shortest route.

---


<!-- Page 14 has tables: 5r x 3c (Tiny, 2½ by 2½ feet, 4 per square) -->
	 The GM might require you to use an action for 
any of these activities when it needs special care or
when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance,
the GM might require you to take the Utilize action
to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a
drawbridge.
Doing Nothing on Your Turn. You can forgo mov-
ing, taking an action, or doing anything at all on
your turn. If you can’t decide what to do, consider
taking the defensive Dodge action or the Ready ac-
tion to delay acting.

Ending Combat
Combat ends when one side or the other is defeated,
which can mean the creatures are killed or knocked
out or have surrendered or fled. Combat can also
end when both sides agree to end it.
Movement and Position

On your turn, you can move a distance equal to your
Speed or less. Or you can decide not to move.
Your movement can include climbing, crawling,
jumping, and swimming (each explained in “Rules
Glossary”). These different modes of movement can
be combined with your regular movement, or they
can constitute your entire move.
However you’re moving with your Speed, you
deduct the distance of each part of your move from
it until it is used up or until you are done moving,
whichever comes first.
A character’s Speed is determined during char-
acter creation. A monster’s Speed is noted in the
monster’s stat block. See “Rules Glossary” for more
about Speed as well as about special speeds, such as
a Climb Speed, Fly Speed, or Swim Speed.

Difficult Terrain
Combatants are often slowed down by Difficult
Terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep
stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of Diffi-
cult Terrain.
Every foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs
1 extra foot, even if multiple things in a space count
as Difficult Terrain.

Breaking Up Your Move
You can break up your move, using some of its
movement before and after any action, Bonus Ac-
tion, or Reaction you take on the same turn. For
example, if you have a Speed of 30 feet, you could go
10 feet, take an action, and then go 20 feet.

Dropping Prone
On your turn, you can give yourself the Prone condi-
tion (see “Rules Glossary”) without using an action
or any of your Speed, but you can’t do so if your
Speed is 0.

Creature Size
A creature belongs to a size category, which deter-
mines the width of the square space the creature
occupies on a map, as shown on the Creature Size
and Space table. That table lists the sizes from
smallest (Tiny) to largest (Gargantuan). A creature’s
space is the area that it effectively controls in com-
bat and the area it needs to fight effectively.
A character’s size is determined by species, and
a monster’s size is specified in the monster’s stat
block.

Creature Size and Space

Size
Space (Feet)
Space (Squares)

Tiny
2½ by 2½ feet
4 per square

Small
5 by 5 feet
1 square

Medium
5 by 5 feet
1 square

Large
10 by 10 feet
4 squares (2 by 2)

Huge
15 by 15 feet
9 squares (3 by 3)

Gargantuan
20 by 20 feet
16 squares (4 by 4)

Moving around Other Creatures
During your move, you can pass through the space
of an ally, a creature that has the Incapacitated
condition (see “Rules Glossary”), a Tiny creature, or
a creature that is two sizes larger or smaller than
you.
Another creature’s space is Difficult Terrain for
you unless that creature is Tiny or your ally.
You can’t willingly end a move in a space occupied
by another creature. If you somehow end a turn in
a space with another creature, you have the Prone
condition (see “Rules Glossary”) unless you are Tiny
or are of a larger size than the other creature.
Making an Attack

When you take the Attack action, you make an
attack. Some other actions, Bonus Actions, and Re-
actions also let you make an attack. Whether you
strike with a Melee weapon, fire a Ranged weapon,

Unseen Attackers and Targets

When you make an attack roll against a target you
can’t see, you have Disadvantage on the roll. This is
true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or
targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the
target isn’t in the location you targeted, you miss.
When a creature can’t see you, you have Advantage
on attack rolls against it.
If you are hidden when you make an attack roll,
you give away your location when the attack hits or
misses.

---


<!-- Page 15 has tables: 3r x 3c (Half, +2 bonus to AC
, Another creatur) -->
or make an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack
has the following structure:

1:	Choose a Target. Pick a target within your at-
tack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2:	Determine Modifiers. The GM determines
whether the target has Cover (see the next sec-
tion) and whether you have Advantage or Dis-
advantage against the target. In addition, spells,
special abilities, and other effects can apply pen-
alties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3:	Resolve the Attack. Make the attack roll, as
detailed earlier in “Playing the Game.” On a hit,
you roll damage unless the particular attack
has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks
cause special effects in addition to or instead of
damage.
Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can pro-
vide cover, making a target more difficult to harm.
As detailed in the Cover table, there are three de-
grees of cover, each of which gives a different bene-
fit to a target.
A target can benefit from cover only when an at-
tack or other effect originates on the opposite side
of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources
of cover, only the most protective degree of cover
applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For ex-
ample, if a target is behind a creature that gives Half
Cover and a tree trunk that gives Three-Quarters
Cover, the target has Three-Quarters Cover.

Ranged Attacks

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow,
hurl an axe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a
foe at a distance. Many spells also involve making a
ranged attack.

Range
You can make ranged attacks only against targets
within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as
one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t
attack a target beyond this range.

	 Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a 
Longbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is
the normal range, and the larger number is the long
range. Your attack roll has Disadvantage when your
target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack
a target beyond long range.

Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe
is next to you. When you make a ranged attack roll
with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you
have Disadvantage on the roll if you are within 5
feet of an enemy who can see you and doesn’t have
the Incapacitated condition (see “Rules Glossary”).
Melee Attacks

A melee attack allows you to attack a target within
your reach. A melee attack typically uses a hand-
held weapon or an Unarmed Strike. Many monsters
make melee attacks with claws, teeth, or other body
parts. A few spells also involve melee attacks.

Reach
A creature has a 5-foot reach and can thus attack
targets within 5 feet when making a melee attack.
Certain creatures have melee attacks with a reach
greater than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

Opportunity Attacks
Combatants watch for enemies to drop their guard.
If you move heedlessly past your foes, you put your-
self in danger by provoking an Opportunity Attack.
Avoiding Opportunity Attacks. You can avoid
provoking an Opportunity Attack by taking the
Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an Oppor-
tunity Attack when you Teleport or when you are
moved without using your movement, action, Bonus
Action, or Reaction. For example, you don’t provoke
an Opportunity Attack if an explosion hurls you out
of a foe’s reach or if you fall past an enemy.
Making an Opportunity Attack. You can make an
Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can
see leaves your reach. To make the attack, take a Re-
action to make one melee attack with a weapon or
an Unarmed Strike against that creature. The attack
occurs right before it leaves your reach.
Mounted Combat

A willing creature that is at least one size larger
than a rider and that has an appropriate anatomy
can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

Mounting and Dismounting
During your move, you can mount a creature that
is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs
an amount of movement equal to half your Speed
(round down). For example, if your Speed is 30 feet,
you spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse.

---

Controlling a Mount
You can control a mount only if it has been trained
to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, mules, and
similar creatures have such training.
The Initiative of a controlled mount changes to
match yours when you mount it. It moves on your
turn as you direct it, and it has only three action op-
tions during that turn: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge.
A controlled mount can move and act even on the
turn that you mount it.
In contrast, an independent mount—one that lets
you ride but ignores your control—retains its place
in the Initiative order and moves and acts as it likes.

Falling Off
If an effect is about to move your mount against its
will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity saving throw or fall off, landing with the
Prone condition (see “Rules Glossary”) in an unoc-
cupied space within 5 feet of the mount.
While mounted, you must make the same save if
you’re knocked Prone or the mount is.
Underwater Combat

A fight underwater follows these rules.

Impeded Weapons
When making a melee attack roll with a weapon
underwater, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed has
Disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon
deals Piercing damage.
A ranged attack roll with a weapon underwater
automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s
normal range, and the attack roll has Disadvantage
against a target within normal range.

Fire Resistance
Anything underwater has Resistance to Fire dam-
age (explained in “Damage and Healing”).
Damage and Healing
Injury and death are frequent threats, as detailed in
the following rules.
Hit Points

Hit Points represent durability and the will to live.
Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult
to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of

Resting

Adventurers can’t spend every hour adventuring.
They need rest. Any creature can take hour-long
Short Rests in the midst of a day and an 8-hour Long
Rest to end it. Regaining Hit Points is one of the main
benefits of a rest. “Rules Glossary” provides the
rules for Short and Long Rests.

Hit Points you have when uninjured. Your current
Hit Points can be any number from that maximum
down to 0, which is the lowest Hit Points can go.
Whenever you take damage, subtract it from your
Hit Points. Hit Point loss has no effect on your capa-
bilities until you reach 0 Hit Points.
If you have half your Hit Points or fewer, you’re
Bloodied, which has no game effect on its own but
which might trigger other game effects.
Damage Rolls

Each weapon, spell, and damaging monster ability
specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage
dice, add any modifiers, and deal the damage to
your target. If there’s a penalty to the damage, it’s
possible to deal 0 damage but not negative damage.
When attacking with a weapon, you add your abil-
ity modifier—the same modifier used for the attack
roll—to the damage roll. A spell tells you which dice
to roll for damage and whether to add any modi-
fiers. Unless a rule says otherwise, you don’t add
your ability modifier to a fixed damage amount that
doesn’t use a roll, such as the damage of a Blowgun.
See “Equipment” for weapons’ damage dice and
“Spells” for spells’ damage dice.
Critical Hits

When you score a Critical Hit, you deal extra dam-
age. Roll the attack’s damage dice twice, add them
together, and add any relevant modifiers as normal.
For example, if you score a Critical Hit with a Dag-
ger, roll 2d4 for the damage rather than 1d4, and
add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack in-
volves other damage dice, such as from the Rogue’s
Sneak Attack feature, you also roll those dice twice.
Saving Throws and Damage

Damage dealt via saving throws uses these rules.

Damage against Multiple Targets
When you create a damaging effect that forces two
or more targets to make saving throws against it at
the same time, roll the damage once for all the tar-
gets. For example, when a wizard casts Fireball, the
spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught
in the blast.

Half Damage
Many saving throw effects deal half damage (round
down) to a target when the target succeeds on the
saving throw. The halved damage is equal to half
the damage that would be dealt on a failed save.
Damage Types

Each instance of damage has a type, like Fire
or Slashing. Damage types are listed in “Rules

---

Glossary” and have no rules of their own, but other
rules, such as Resistance, rely on damage types.
Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects have Resistance or
Vulnerability to certain damage types. If you have
Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type
is halved against you (round down). If you have
Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type
is doubled against you. For example, if you have
Resistance to Cold damage, such damage is halved
against you, and if you have Vulnerability to Fire
damage, such damage is doubled against you.

No Stacking
Multiple instances of Resistance or Vulnerability
that affect the same damage type count as only one
instance. For example, if you have Resistance to Ne-
crotic damage as well as Resistance to all damage,
Necrotic damage is reduced by half against you.

Order of Application
Modifiers to damage are applied in the following
order: adjustments such as bonuses, penalties, or
multipliers are applied first; Resistance is applied
second; and Vulnerability is applied third.
For example, a creature has Resistance to all dam-
age and Vulnerability to Fire damage, and it’s within
a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. If it
takes 28 Fire damage, the damage is first reduced
by 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature’s Resis-
tance (and rounded down to 11), then doubled for
its Vulnerability (to 22).
Immunity

Some creatures and objects have Immunity to cer-
tain damage types and conditions. Immunity to a
damage type means you don’t take damage of that
type, and Immunity to a condition means you aren’t
affected by it.
Healing

Hit Points can be restored by magic, such as the
Cure Wounds spell or a Potion of Healing, or by a
Short or Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”).

Knocking Out a Creature

When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points
with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the crea-
ture to 1 Hit Point and give it the Unconscious condi-
tion. It then starts a Short Rest, at the end of which
that condition ends on it. The condition ends early
if the creature regains any Hit Points or if someone
takes an action to administer first aid to it, making a
successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

	 When you receive healing, add the restored Hit 
Points to your current Hit Points. Your Hit Points
can’t exceed your Hit Point maximum, so any Hit
Points regained in excess of the maximum are lost.
For example, if you receive 8 Hit Points of healing
and have 14 Hit Points and a Hit Point maximum of
20, you regain 6 Hit Points, not 8.
Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it either dies
outright or falls unconscious, as explained below.

Instant Death
Here are the main ways a creature can die instantly.
Monster Death. A monster dies the instant it
drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Game Master can
ignore this rule for an individual monster and treat
it like a character.
Hit Point Maximum of 0. A creature dies if its Hit
Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life
energy, reducing a creature’s Hit Point maximum.
Massive Damage. When damage reduces a char-
acter to 0 Hit Points and damage remains, the char-
acter dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their
Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character
has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit
Points, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to
0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character
then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum.

Character Demise
If your character dies, others might find a magical
way to revive your character, such as with the Raise
Dead spell. Or talk with the GM about making a new
character to join the group. “Rules Glossary” has
more information on being dead.

Falling Unconscious
If you reach 0 Hit Points and don’t die instantly, you
have the Unconscious condition (see “Rules Glos-
sary”) until you regain any Hit Points, and you now
face making Death Saving Throws (see below).

Death Saving Throws
Whenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Points,
you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine
whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life.
Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to an
ability score. You’re in the hands of fate now.
Three Successes/Failures. Roll 1d20. If the roll
is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A
success or failure has no effect by itself. On your
third success, you become Stable (see “Stabilizing a
Character” below). On your third failure, you die.
The successes and failures don’t need to be con-
secutive; keep track of both until you collect three
of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when
you regain any Hit Points or become Stable.

---

	 Rolling a 1 or 20. When you roll a 1 on the d20 
for a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If
you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 Hit Point.
Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage
while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Sav-
ing Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical
Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage
equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.

Stabilizing a Character
You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a
creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a suc-
cessful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
A Stable creature doesn’t make Death Saving
Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still
has the Unconscious condition. If the creature takes
damage, it stops being Stable and starts making
Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that
isn’t healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours.
Temporary Hit Points

Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit
Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit
Points, as explained below.

Lose Temporary Hit Points First
If you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage,
those points are lost first, and any leftover damage
carries over to your Hit Points. For example, if you
have 5 Temporary Hit Points and take 7 damage,
you lose those points and then lose 2 Hit Points.

Duration
Temporary Hit Points last until they’re depleted or
you finish a Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”).

They Don’t Stack
Temporary Hit Points can’t be added together. If
you have Temporary Hit Points and receive more
of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you
have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell
grants you 12 Temporary Hit Points when you al-
ready have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

They’re Not Hit Points or Healing
Temporary Hit Points can’t be added to your Hit
Points, healing can’t restore them, and receiving
Temporary Hit Points doesn’t count as healing. Be-
cause Temporary Hit Points aren’t Hit Points, a crea-
ture can be at full Hit Points and receive Temporary
Hit Points.
If you have 0 Hit Points, receiving Temporary Hit
Points doesn’t restore you to consciousness. Only
true healing can save you.

Character
Creation

Choose a Character Sheet
You’ll record the main details of your character on
a character sheet. Throughout this chapter, we use
the term “character sheet” to mean whatever you
use to track your character’s details, whether it’s a
printed character sheet, a digital character sheet, or
plain paper. Choose whichever style of sheet works
for you, and then embark on creating a character!
Create Your Character
Here are the steps to make a character; each step is
explored in detail:

1:	Choose a Class. Every adventurer is a member
of a class. A class broadly describes a character’s
vocation, special talents, and favored tactics.
2:	Determine Origin. A character’s origin includes
two elements: background and species. How did
the character spend the years leading up to a life
of adventure? Who are the character’s ancestors?
You can also choose your character’s languages.
3:	Determine Ability Scores. Much of what your
character does in the game depends on the char-
acter’s six abilities.
4:	Choose an Alignment. Alignment is a shorthand
for your character’s moral compass.
5:	Fill in Details. Using the choices you’ve made, fill
in the remaining details on your character sheet.
Step 1: Choose Class

Choose a class, and write it on your character sheet.
The Class Overview table summarizes the classes.
See “Classes” for the classes’ details.

Write Your Level
Write your character’s level on your character
sheet. Typically, a character starts at level 1 and
advances in level by adventuring and gaining Expe-
rience Points (XP).
Write Your XP. Also record your Experience
Points. A level 1 character has 0 XP.
Starting at a Higher Level. Your GM might start
you at a higher level. If you start at level 3 or higher,
write your chosen subclass on your character sheet.
See the “Starting at Higher Levels” section later in
“Character Creation” for more information.

Note Armor Training
Your class might give you training with certain
categories of armor. Note your armor training on
your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of
armor means you can wear that armor effectively,
gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of
armor are described in “Equipment.”
Step 2: Character Origin

Determining your character’s origin involves choos-
ing a background, a species, and two languages.
A character’s background represents the place
and occupation that were most formative for the
character. The combination of background, species,
and languages provides fertile soil for your imagi-
nation as you ponder your character’s earliest days.

Choose a Background
Choose your character’s background, and write it on
your character sheet. You can choose any of the back-
grounds detailed in “Character Origins,” and your GM
might offer additional backgrounds as options.
The background you choose influences step 3,
when you determine your character’s ability scores.
If you’re having trouble choosing, the Ability Scores
and Backgrounds table shows which backgrounds
benefit which ability scores. Look for your class’s
primary ability there.

Acolyte

	 Record Your Feat. A background gives you a feat, 
which grants your character particular capabilities.
Feats are detailed in “Feats.” Write the feat on your
character sheet.
Note Proficiencies. Your background gives profi-
ciency in two skills and with one tool. Record this
information on your character sheet.
Your class also gives proficiencies. Check your
class description in “Classes” and note the proficien-
cies on your character sheet.
The features table in your class description shows
your Proficiency Bonus (described in “Playing the
Game”), which is +2 for a level 1 character. Note this
number on your character sheet. You’ll fill in other
numbers connected to these proficiencies in step 5.

Choose Starting Equipment
Your background and class both provide starting
equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step
can be immediately spent on equipment from
“Equipment.”
Record your chosen equipment on your character
sheet. Equipment is described in “Equipment,” but
for now you can just write it all down and look up
the specifics in “Equipment” later. Note any coins
you have left after purchasing your equipment.

Choose a Species
Choose a species for your character. The following
species options are detailed in “Character Origins”:
Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling,
Human, Orc, and Tiefling. Once you’ve chosen a spe-
cies, write it on your character sheet. Then record
your species’ traits.
Your character’s size and Speed are determined
by the character’s species; record these in the ap-
propriate places on your character sheet as well
(you may write just the first letter of your size).

Imagine Your Past and Present
Let your character’s background and species inspire
how you imagine their past. That past fed into the
character’s present. With that in mind, consider an-
swers to the following questions as your character:

•	 Who raised you?
•	 Who was your dearest childhood friend?
•	 Did you grow up with a pet?
•	 Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?
•	 Did you join an organization, such as a guild or re-
ligion? If so, are you still a member of it?
•	 What elements of your past inspire you to go on
adventures now?

Choose Languages
Your character knows at least three languages:
Common plus two languages you roll or choose
from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a
language means your character can communicate in
it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features
might also give you languages.
The Standard Languages table lists languages that
are widespread in the setting. Every player charac-
ter knows Common. The other standard languages
originated with the first members of the most
prominent species in the setting and have since
spread widely.

tence and thus less widespread in the worlds of the
Material Plane. Some features let a character learn a
rare language.

Creatures that know one of these dialects can communicate with
those that know a different one.

Step 3: Ability Scores

To determine your character’s ability scores, you
first generate a set of six numbers using the instruc-
tions below and then assign them to your six abili-
ties. “Playing the Game” explains what each ability
means.

---


<!-- Page 21 has tables: 5r x 2c (3, −4); 3r x 2c (14–15, +2); 3r x 2c (8, 0); 3r x 2c (12, 4); 11r x 7c (Barbarian, 15, 13) -->
Generate Your Scores
Determine your ability scores by using one of the
following three methods. Your GM might prefer you
to use a particular one.
Standard Array. Use the following six scores for
your abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
Random Generation. Roll four d6s and record
the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more
times, so you have six numbers.
Point Cost. You have 27 points to spend on your
ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on
the Ability Score Point Costs table. For example, a
score of 14 costs 7 of your 27 points.

Assign Ability Scores
Once you’ve generated six scores, assign them to
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wis-
dom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class’s
primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well.
If you’re using the Standard Array option, consult
the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions
on where to assign scores for your character’s class.
The table puts the highest scores in a class’s main
abilities. If you used a different method to gener-
ate the scores, you may still use this table to guide
where you place your highest and lowest scores.

Adjust Ability Scores
After assigning your ability scores, adjust them ac-
cording to your background. Your background lists
three abilities; increase one of those scores by 2 and

a different one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None
of these increases can raise a score above 20.
Some players like to increase their class’s primary
ability, while others prefer to increase a low score.

Determine Ability Modifiers
Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the
Ability Scores and Modifiers table. Write the modi-
fier next to each of your scores.

Step 4: Alignment

Choose your character’s alignment from the options
below, and note it on your character sheet.
The game assumes that player characters aren’t of
an evil alignment. Check with your GM before mak-
ing an evil character.

The Nine Alignments
A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical
attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of
two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or
neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward
order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).
The summaries of the alignments below describe
the typical behavior of a creature with that align-
ment; individuals can vary from that behavior.
Lawful Good (LG). Lawful Good creatures en-
deavor to do the right thing as expected by society.
Someone who fights injustice and protects the inno-
cent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.
Neutral Good (NG). Neutral Good creatures do the
best they can, working within rules but not feeling
bound by them. A kindly person who helps others
according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.
Chaotic Good (CG). Chaotic Good creatures act as
their conscience directs with little regard for what
others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron’s
tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the
poor is probably Chaotic Good.
Lawful Neutral (LN). Lawful Neutral individuals
act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal
codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of
life—and isn’t swayed either by the demands of
those in need or by the temptations of evil—is prob-
ably Lawful Neutral.
Neutral (N). Neutral is the alignment of those who
prefer to avoid moral questions and don’t take sides,

---


<!-- Page 22 has tables: 3r x 2c (Barbarian, 12 + Con. modif) -->
Unaligned Creatures

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational
thought don’t have alignments; they are unaligned.
Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they
aren’t evil; they are unaligned.

doing what seems best at the time. Someone who’s
bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.
Chaotic Neutral (CN). Chaotic Neutral creatures
follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom
above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land
living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.
Lawful Evil (LE). Lawful Evil creatures methodi-
cally take what they want within the limits of a code
of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploit-
ing citizens while scheming for power is probably
Lawful Evil.
Neutral Evil (NE). Neutral Evil is the alignment of
those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as
they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and
murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.
Chaotic Evil (CE). Chaotic Evil creatures act
with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or
bloodlust. A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance
and havoc is probably Chaotic Evil.
Step 5: Character Creation Details

Now fill in the rest of your character sheet.

Record Class Features
Look at your class’s feature table in “Classes,” and
write down the level 1 features. The class features
are detailed there too.
Some class features offer choices. Make sure to
read all your features and make any offered choices.

Fill In Numbers
Note these numbers on your character sheet.
Saving Throws. For the saving throws you have
proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ap-
propriate ability modifier and note the total. Some
players also like to note the modifier for saving
throws they’re not proficient in, which is just the
relevant ability modifier.
Skills. For skills you have proficiency in, add your
Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated
with that skill, and note the total. You might also
wish to note the modifier for skills you’re not profi-
cient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.
Passive Perception. Sometimes your GM will de-
termine whether your character notices something
without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception)
check; the GM uses your Passive Perception instead.
Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general
awareness of your surroundings when you’re not
actively looking for something. Use this formula to
determine your Passive Perception score:

Passive Perception = 10 + Wisdom (Perception)
check modifier

Include all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom
(Perception) checks. For example, if your character
has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Percep-
tion skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 +
2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency).
Hit Points. Your class and Constitution modifier
determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1, as
shown on the Level 1 Hit Points by Class table.

Level 1 Hit Points by Class

Class
Hit Point Maximum

Barbarian
12 + Con. modifier

Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger
10 + Con. modifier

Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk,
Rogue, or Warlock
8 + Con. modifier

Sorcerer or Wizard
6 + Con. modifier

The character sheet includes room to note your
current Hit Points when you take damage, as well as
any Temporary Hit Points you might gain. There’s
also space to track Death Saving Throws.
Hit Point Dice. Your class’s description tells you
the die type of your character’s Hit Point Dice (or
Hit Dice for short); write this on your character
sheet. At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You
can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover
Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space
to note how many Hit Dice you’ve spent.
Initiative. Write your Dexterity modifier in the
space for Initiative on your character sheet.
Armor Class. Without armor or a shield, your
base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modi-
fier. If your starting equipment includes armor or a
Shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in
“Equipment.” A class feature might give you a differ-
ent way to calculate your AC.
Attacks. In the Weapons & Damage Cantrips
section of the character sheet, write your starting
weapons. The attack roll bonus for a weapon with
which you have proficiency is one of the following
unless a weapon’s property says otherwise:

Melee attack bonus = Strength modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
  Ranged attack bonus = Dexterity modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus

  Look up the damage and properties of your
  weapons in “Equipment.” You add the same ability
  modifier you use for attacks with a weapon to your
  damage rolls with that weapon.
  Spellcasting. Note both the saving throw DC for
  your spells and the attack bonus for attacks you
  make with them, using these formulas:

---


<!-- Page 23 has tables: 3r x 2c (Barbarian, 7 + Con. modifi); 19r x 3c (1, 0, +2) -->
Spell save DC = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
  Spell attack bonus = spellcasting ability modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus

  Your spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is de-
  termined by whatever feature gives you the ability
  to cast the spell.
  Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells. If
  your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic
  feature, your class features table shows the number
  of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips
  you know, and how many spells you can prepare.
  Choose your cantrips and prepared spells, and note
  them—along with your number of spell slots—on
  your character sheet.
  Level Advancement
  While going on adventures, your character gains ex-
  perience, represented by Experience Points (XP). A
  character who reaches a specified Experience Point
  total advances in capability. This advancement is
  called gaining a level.
  The Character Advancement table lists the XP
  you need to advance to a level and the Proficiency
  Bonus for a character of that level. When your XP
  total equals or exceeds a number in the Experience
  Points column, you reach the corresponding level.

Gaining a Level

When you gain a level, follow these steps:

1:	Choose a Class. Most characters advance in the
same class. However, you might decide to gain a
level in another class using the rules in the “Mul-
ticlassing” section.
2:	Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice. Each time
you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die.
Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to
the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your
Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can
use the fixed value shown in the Fixed Hit Points
by Class table.

Fixed Hit Points by Class

Class
Hit Points per Level

Barbarian
7 + Con. modifier

Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger
6 + Con. modifier

Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk,
Rogue, or Warlock
5 + Con. modifier

Sorcerer or Wizard
4 + Con. modifier

3:	Record New Class Features. Look at your class
features table in “Classes,” and note the features
you gain at your new level in that class. Make any
choices offered by a new feature.
4:	Adjust Proficiency Bonus. A character’s Pro-
ficiency Bonus increases at certain levels, as
shown in the Character Advancement table and
your class features table in “Classes.” When your
Proficiency Bonus increases, increase all the
numbers on your character sheet that include
your Proficiency Bonus.
5:	Adjust Ability Modifiers. If you choose a feat
that increases one or more of your ability scores,
your ability modifier also changes if the new
score is an even number. When that happens, ad-
just all the numbers on your character sheet that
use that ability modifier. When your Constitution
modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum
increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
For example, if a character reaches level 8 and
increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18,
the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The
character’s Hit Point maximum then increases by
8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reach-
ing level 8.
Tiers of Play

With each new level, characters acquire new ca-
pabilities that equip them to handle greater chal-
lenges. As characters advance in level, the tone of
the game also changes, and the stakes of the cam-
paign get higher. It’s helpful to think of a character’s
(and a campaign’s) arc in terms of four tiers of play,

---


<!-- Page 24 has tables: 3r x 3c (2–4, Normal starting, 1 Common) -->
describing the journey from a level 1 character just
beginning an adventuring career to the epic heights
of level 20. These tiers don’t have any rules associ-
ated with them; they point to the fact that the play
experience evolves as characters gain levels.

Tier 1 (Levels 1–4)
In tier 1, characters are apprentice adventurers,
though they are already set apart from the broader
populace by virtue of their extraordinary abilities.
They learn their starting class features and choose
a subclass. The threats they face usually pose a dan-
ger to local farmsteads or villages.

Tier 2 (Levels 5–10)
In tier 2, characters are full-fledged adventurers.
Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as Fireball, Light-
ning Bolt, and Raise Dead. Most weapon-focused
classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks
in a round. The characters now face dangers that
threaten cities and kingdoms.

Tier 3 (Levels 11–16)
In tier 3, characters have reached a level of power
that makes them special among adventurers. At
level 11, many spell­casters learn reality-altering
spells. Other characters gain features that allow
them to make more attacks or to do more impres-
sive things with those attacks. These adventurers
often confront threats to whole regions.

Tier 4 (Levels 17–20)
At tier 4, characters achieve the pinnacle of their
class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The
fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse
might hang in the balance during their adventures.
Starting at Higher Levels
Your GM might start your group’s characters at a
level higher than 1. It is particularly recommended
to start at level 3 if your group is composed of sea-
soned D&D players.
Creating Your Character

Creating a higher-level character uses the same
character-creation steps outlined in this chapter
and the rules for advancing beyond level 1 provided

Starting Equipment at Higher Levels

5,000 gp plus 1d10 × 250 GP plus
normal starting equipment
2 Common, 3 Uncommon, 1 Rare

Bonus Feats at Level 20

A GM can use feats as a form of advancement after
characters reach level 20 to provide greater power
to characters who have no more levels to gain. With
this approach, each character gains one feat of their
choice for every 30,000 XP the character earns
above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon feats are especially
appropriate for these bonus feats, but a player can
choose any feat for which their level 20 character
qualifies.

in the “Level Advancement” section. You begin with
the minimum amount of XP required to reach your
starting level. For example, if the GM starts you at
level 10, you have 64,000 XP.
Starting Equipment

The GM decides whether your character starts with
more than the standard equipment for a level 1
character, possibly even one or more magic items.
The Starting Equipment at Higher Levels table is a
guide for the GM.
Also, check with your GM about what equipment
is available for you to buy with your starting money.
For example, the firearms described in “Equipment”
are too expensive for level 1 characters, but they
might be available for purchase if your GM allows
them.
Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple
classes. With this rule, you have the option of gain-
ing a level in a new class whenever you advance in
level instead of gaining a level in your current class.
Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes
to realize a character concept that might not be re-
flected in a single class.
Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of
at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class
and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian
who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must
have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher,

17–20
20,000 GP plus 1d10 × 250 GP plus
normal starting equipment
2 Common, 4 Uncommon, 3 Rare, 1 Very Rare

---

since Strength is the primary ability for Barbarians
and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.
Experience Points

The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on
your total character level, not your level in a partic-
ular class, as shown in the Character Advancement
table in “Character Creation.” For example, if you
are a level 6 Cleric / level 1 Fighter, you must gain
enough XP to reach level 8 before you can take your
second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a
Cleric.
Hit Points and Hit Point Dice

You gain the Hit Points from your new class as de-
scribed for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit
Points for a class only when your total character
level is 1.
Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your
classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice
are the same die type, you can pool them together.
For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have
a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5
Paladin, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes
give you Hit Dice of different types, track them sep-
arately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin,
for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10
Hit Dice.
Proficiency Bonus

Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total char-
acter level, not your level in a particular class, as
shown in the Character Advancement table. For
example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue,
you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 charac-
ter, which is +3.
Proficiencies

When you gain your first level in a class other than
your initial class, you gain only some of the new
class’s starting proficiencies, as detailed in each
class’s description in “Classes.”
Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its fea-
tures for that level. A few features have additional
rules when you’re multiclassing. Check the infor-
mation about multiclassing included in each of your
classes’ descriptions.
Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting,
and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give
you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.

Armor Class
If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor
Class, you can benefit from only one at a time.
For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk’s

Unarmored Defense feature and a Sorcerer’s Dra-
conic Resilience feature must choose only one of
those features as a way to calculate Armor Class.

Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than
one class, the features don’t stack. You can’t make
more than two attacks with this feature unless you
have a feature that says you can (such as the Fight-
er’s Two Extra Attacks feature).
Similarly, the Warlock’s Thirsting Blade invo-
cation, which grants you the Extra Attack feature
with your pact weapon, doesn’t give you additional
attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on
your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes
and partly on your individual levels in those classes.
Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more
than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass
but have the Spellcasting feature from only one
class, follow the rules for that class.
Spells Prepared. You determine what spells you
can prepare for each class individually, as if you
were a single-classed member of that class. If you
are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example,
you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you
can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as
well as four Sorcerer cantrips).
Each spell you prepare is associated with one of
your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of
that class when you cast the spell.
Cantrips. If a cantrip of yours increases in power
at higher levels, the increase is based on your total
character level, not your level in a particular class,
unless the spell says otherwise.
Spell Slots. You determine your available spell
slots by adding together the following:

•	 All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer,
and Wizard classes
•	 Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and
Ranger classes

Then look up this total level in the Level column of
the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for
that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from
any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.
This table might give you spell slots of a higher
level than the spells you prepare. You can use those
slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a
lower-level spell that you cast, like Burning Hands,
has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level,
you can use the enhanced effect as normal.
For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3
Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when de-
termining your spell slots, counting all your levels
as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown

<!-- Page 26 has tables: 33r x 2c (01, A mummified gob); 19r x 10c (1, 2, —) -->
in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four
level 1 spell slots, three level 2 slots, and two level 3
slots. However, you can’t prepare any level 3 spells,
nor can you prepare any level 2 Ranger spells. You
can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the
spells you do prepare—and potentially enhance
their effects.
Pact Magic. If you have the Pact Magic feature
from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature,
you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic
to cast spells you have prepared from classes with
the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spell
slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast
Warlock spells you have prepared.

Character Origins

Character Backgrounds
Your character’s background is a collection of char-
acteristics that represent the place and occupation
that were most formative before your character em-
barked on a life of adventure.
Parts of a Background

A background includes the following parts.

Ability Scores
A background lists three of your character’s ability
scores. Increase one by 2 and another one by 1, or
increase all three by 1. None of these increases can
raise a score above 20.

Feat
A background gives your character a specified Ori-
gin feat (described in “Feats”).

Skill Proficiencies
A background gives your character proficiency in
two specified skills.

Tool Proficiency
Each background gives a character proficiency with
one tool—either a specific tool or one chosen from
the Artisan’s Tools category. Tools are detailed in
“Equipment.”

Equipment
Each background offers a choice between a package
of equipment and 50 GP.

Character Species
When you choose your character’s species, you
determine whether your character is a human or a
member of a fantastical species, such as dragonborn
or gnome.
The peoples of the multiverse hail from different
worlds and include many kinds of sapient life forms.
A player character’s species is the set of game traits
that an adventurer gains from being one of those
life forms.
Some species can trace their origin to a single
world, plane of existence, or god, while other spe-
cies first appeared in multiple realms at once.
Whatever a species’ genesis, its members have
spread across the multiverse and contribute to
many different cultures.
Members of most species live for about 80 years,
with exceptions noted in the text about the spe-
cies in “Character Origins.” Regardless of life span,
members of all species reach physical maturity at
about the same age. Your character can be any age
that isn’t beyond their species’ normal life span.
Parts of a Species

A species includes the following parts.

Creature Type
A character’s species determines the character’s
creature type, which is described in “Rules Glos-
sary.” Every species in “Character Origins” is Hu-
manoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear in
other books.

Size
Your character’s species determines the character’s
size. Individuals within a species cover a wide range
of heights, and some species include such diversity

---

of size that you can choose whether your character
is Small or Medium.

Speed
Your character’s species determines the character’s
Speed.

Special Traits
Each species gives a character special traits—
unique characteristics based on the species’ physi-
ology or magical nature. When you choose a species,
your character gets all the special traits listed for it.
Some traits involve making a choice from a handful
of options.

Speed: 30 feet

on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks
with an exhalation of magical energy in either a
15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide
(choose the shape each time). Each creature in that
area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus
your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus).
On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of
the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry
trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as
much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when
you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and

You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it
once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability
to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest.

have of the appropriate level.

you determine its function by choosing one effect
from Prestidigitation; the device produces that

Detect Magic
Misty Step

effect whenever you or another creature takes a
Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the cho-
sen effect has options within it, you choose one of
those options for the device when you create it.
For example, if you choose the spell’s ignite-extin-
guish effect, you determine whether the device
ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn’t do
both. You can have three such devices in existence
at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its
creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as
a Utilize action.

can take a Reaction to deal 1d8 Thunder damage
to that creature.

	 Large Form. Starting at character level 5, you can 
change your size to Large as a Bonus Action if you’re
in a big enough space. This transformation lasts for

Equipment

Coins
Characters often find coins on their adventures
and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other
businesses. Coins come in different denominations
based on the relative worth of their material. The
Coin Values table lists coins and how much they’re
worth relative to the Gold Piece, which is the game’s
main coin. For example, 100 Copper Pieces are
worth 1 Gold Piece.
A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty
coins weigh a pound.

Weapons
The Weapons table in this section shows the game’s
main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of
each weapon, as well as the following details:

Category. Every weapon falls into a category: Sim-
ple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually
tied to one of these categories. For example, you
might have proficiency with Simple weapons.
Melee or Ranged. A weapon is classified as either
Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to at-
tack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged
weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.
Damage. The table lists the amount of damage a
weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well
as the type of that damage.
Properties. Any properties a weapon has are listed
in the Properties column. Each property is de-
fined in the “Properties” section.
Mastery. Each weapon has a mastery property,
which is defined in the “Mastery Properties” sec-
tion. To use that property, you must have a feature
that lets you use it.

Selling Equipment

Equipment fetches half its cost when sold. In con-
trast, trade goods and valuables—like gems and art
objects—retain their full value in the marketplace.
“Magic Items” has prices for magic items.

Weapon Proficiency

Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have
proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to
an attack roll you make with it. A player character’s
features can provide weapon proficiencies. A mon-
ster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.
Properties

Here are definitions of the properties in the Proper-
ties column of the Weapons table.

Ammunition
You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition
property to make a ranged attack only if you have
ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition
required is specified with the weapon’s range. Each
attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing
the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a
free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a
fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the
ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the
rest is lost.

Finesse
When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use
your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier
for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the
same modifier for both rolls.

Heavy
You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy
weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength
score isn’t at least 13 or if it’s a Ranged weapon and
your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.

Light
When you take the Attack action on your turn and
attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra
attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn.
That extra attack must be made with a different
Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modi-
fier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modi-
fier is negative. For example, you can attack with a
Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other
using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you
don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the
damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modi-
fier is negative.

---

Loading
You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a
Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus
Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the
number of attacks you can normally make.

Range
A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after
the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range
lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal
range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long
range. When attacking a target beyond normal
range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You
can’t attack a target beyond the long range.

Reach
A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you
attack with it, as well as when determining your
reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.

Thrown
If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can
throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and
you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If
the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability
modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you
use for a melee attack with that weapon.

Two-Handed
A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when
you attack with it.

Versatile
A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two
hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with
the property. The weapon deals that damage when
used with two hands to make a melee attack.
Mastery Properties

Each weapon has a mastery property, which is us-
able only by a character who has a feature, such as
Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the
character. The properties are defined below.

Improvised Weapons

If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan,
or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see “Improvised
Weapons” in “Rules Glossary.” Also see those rules
if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using
a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.

Cleave
If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using
this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with
the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet
of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit,
the second creature takes the weapon’s damage,
but don’t add your ability modifier to that damage
unless that modifier is negative. You can make this
extra attack only once per turn.

Graze
If your attack roll with this weapon misses a crea-
ture, you can deal damage to that creature equal
to the ability modifier you used to make the attack
roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the
weapon, and the damage can be increased only by
increasing the ability modifier.

Nick
When you make the extra attack of the Light prop-
erty, you can make it as part of the Attack action in-
stead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra
attack only once per turn.

Push
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push
the creature up to 10 feet straight away from your-
self if it is Large or smaller.

Sap
If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature
has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the
start of your next turn.

Slow
If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal
damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet un-
til the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit
more than once by weapons that have this property,
the Speed reduction doesn’t exceed 10 feet.

Topple
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force
the creature to make a Constitution saving throw
(DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the
attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed
save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Vex
If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal dam-
age to the creature, you have Advantage on your
next attack roll against that creature before the end
of your next turn.

<!-- Page 92 has tables: 17r x 6c (Light Armor (1 ) -->
Armor
The Armor table lists the game’s main armor. The
table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well
as the following details:

Category. Every type of armor falls into a category:
Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines
how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as
shown in the table).
Armor Class (AC). The table’s Armor Class column
tells you what your base AC is when you wear a
type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather
Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity
modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.
Strength. If the table shows a Strength score in the
Strength column for an armor type, that armor
reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the
wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher
than the listed score.
Stealth. If the table shows “Disadvantage” in the
Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has
Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

Armor

Light Armor (1 Minute to Don or Doff)

Medium Armor (5 Minutes to Don and 1 Minute to Doff)

Heavy Armor (10 Minutes to Don and 5 Minutes to Doff)

Shield (Utilize Action to Don or Doff)

Armor Training

Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only
those with training can use them effectively, as

tures determine the character’s armor training.
A monster has training with any armor in its stat
block.

Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor
If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack
training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20
Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you
can’t cast spells.

You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if
you have training with it.

Large Vehicles

The Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table pro-
vides statistics for various types of large vehicles.
The following notes apply.

Speed
A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half
speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships
can’t move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats
and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going
downstream, add the speed of the current (typically
3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These
vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant cur-
rent, but they can be pulled upstream by draft an-
imals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and
weighs 100 pounds.

crew of skilled hirelings (see “Hirelings” later in
“Equipment”) to function. The minimum number of
skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on
the type of ship, as shown in the table.

Passengers
The table lists the number of Small and Medium
passengers the ship can accommodate using ham-
mocks. A ship outfitted with private accommoda-
tions can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A pas-
senger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but
prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private
cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.

Damage Threshold
If a vehicle has a damage threshold (see “Rules Glos-
sary”), it’s noted in the table.

Ship Repair
Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the
vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage
requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and la-
bor. If the repairs are made in a location where sup-
plies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city
shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.
Lifestyle Expenses
Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a
fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment
maintenance, and other necessities.
At the start of each week or month (GM’s choice),
choose a lifestyle below—Wretched, Squalid, Poor,
Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic—and
pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.
Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the
GM might take them into account when determining
risks or how others perceive your character.
Wretched (Free)

You survive via chance and charity. You’re often
exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping
outside.

Magic Items
Adventures hold the promise—but not a guaran-
tee—of finding magic items. Hundreds of magic
items are detailed in “Magic Items” later in this doc-
ument. Here’s what you need to know about using
magic items.
Identifying a Magic Item

Some magic items are indistinguishable from their
nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspic-
uously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to

give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learn-
ing a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic.
The Identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an
item’s properties. Alternatively, you can focus on
one magic item during a Short Rest while being in
physical contact with the item. At the end of the
rest, you learn its properties and how to use them
(but not any curse the item might bear).
Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its prop-
erties. The command word to activate a ring might
be etched inside the band, or a feathered design
might hint that it’s a Ring of Feather Falling.
Wearing or experimenting with an item can also
offer hints about its properties. In the specific case
of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster
what a potion does. Other items might require more
experimentation. For example, if your character
puts on a Ring of Swimming, the GM might say, “Your
movement feels strangely fluid.” Perhaps you then
dive into a river to see what happens. The GM would
then say you swim unexpectedly well.
Attunement

Some magic items require a creature to form a
bond—called Attunement—with them before the
creature can use an item’s magical properties. With-
out becoming attuned to an item that requires At-
tunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits un-
less its description states otherwise. For example, a
magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the
benefits of a normal Shield if you aren’t attuned to
it, but none of its magical properties.

Attune during a Short Rest
Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short
Rest focused on only that item while being in physi-
cal contact with it (this can’t be the same Short Rest
used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can
take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon),
meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate
activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the At-
tunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the
Short Rest, you’re attuned to the magic item and can
access its full magical capabilities.

No More Than Three Items
You can be attuned to no more than three magic
items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth
item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item
first. Additionally, you can’t attune to more than
one copy of an item. For example, you can’t attune to
more than one Ring of Protection at a time.

Ending Attunement
Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer
satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item
has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24
hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to

---


<!-- Page 103 has tables: 9r x 3c (Cantrip, 1 day, 15 GP) -->
the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement
by spending another Short Rest focused on the item
unless the item is cursed.
Wearing and Wielding Items

Using a magic item’s properties might mean wear-
ing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn
must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on
feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head,
and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned,
a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about
the shoulders. A weapon must be held.
In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be
worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build.
Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or
they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.

Multiple Items of the Same Kind
You can’t wear more than one of certain magic
items. You can’t normally wear more than one pair
of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair
of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear,
or one cloak. The GM might make exceptions.

Paired Items
Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers,
gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only
if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a
character wearing a Boot of Striding and Springing
on one foot and a Boot of Elvenkind on the other foot
gains no benefit from either.
Crafting Nonmagical Items
To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw ma-
terials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If
you meet the requirements, you make the item, and
you can use it or sell it at its normal price.
Tools

The “Tools” section of “Equipment” lists which tools
are required to make certain items. The GM assigns
required tools for items not listed there.
You must use the required tool to make an item
and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who
helps you must also have proficiency with it.
Raw Materials

To make an item, you need raw materials worth
half its purchase cost (round down). For example,
you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate
Armor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The GM determines
whether appropriate raw materials are available.
Time

To determine how many days (working 8 hours a
day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase
cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For

example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Cross-
bow, which sells for 50 GP.
If an item requires multiple days, the days needn’t
be consecutive.
Characters can combine their efforts to shorten
the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create
an item by the number of characters working on it.
Normally, only one other character can assist you,
but the GM might allow more assistants.
Brewing Potions of Healing
A character who has proficiency with the Herbalism
Kit can create a Potion of Healing. Doing so requires
using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the
course of 1 day (8 hours of work).
Scribing Spell Scrolls
A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and cre-
ate a Spell Scroll, using the rules below.
Time and Cost

Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money
based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell
Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription, you
must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple
days, those days needn’t be consecutive.
Prerequisites for the Scribe

To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the
Arcana skill or with Calligrapher’s Supplies and
have the spell prepared on each day of the inscrip-
tion. You must also have at hand any Material com-
ponents required by the spell; if the spell consumes
its Material components, they are consumed only
when you complete the scroll. The scroll’s spell uses
your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
Cantrips

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the
scroll works as if the caster were your level.

Spells

Gaining Spells
Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell
prepared in your mind or have access to the spell
from a magic item, such as a Spell Scroll. Your fea-
tures specify which spells you have access to, if any;
whether you always have certain spells prepared;
and whether you can change the list of spells you
have prepared.
Preparing Spells

If you have a list of level 1+ spells you prepare, your
spellcasting feature specifies when you can change
the list and the number of spells you can change, as
summarized in the Spell Preparation by Class table.

Most spellcasting monsters don’t change their lists
of prepared spells, but the GM is free to alter them.
Always-Prepared Spells

Certain features might give you a spell that you
always have prepared. If you also have a list of pre-
pared spells that you can change, a spell that you
always have prepared doesn’t count against the
number of spells on that list.
Casting Spells
Each spell description has a series of entries that
provide the details needed to cast the spell. The fol-
lowing sections explain each of those entries, which
follow a spell’s name.

Casting in Armor

You must have training with any armor you are wear-
ing to cast spells while wearing it. You are otherwise
too hampered by the armor for spellcasting.

Spell Level

Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indi-
cated in a spell’s description. A spell’s level is an
indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips—simple
spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0.
The rules for each spellcasting class say when its
members gain access to spells of certain levels.

Spell Slots
Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only
a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting.
Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster’s magical
potential is represented. Each spellcasting class
gives its members a limited number of spell slots of
certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard
has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.
When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that
spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with
the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain
size—small for a level 1 slot and larger for a high-
er-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any
size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that’s at
least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts Magic
Missile, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of
four level 1 slots and has three remaining.
Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell
slots.

Casting without Slots
There are several ways to cast a spell without
expending a spell slot:

Cantrips. A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.
Rituals. Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the
Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast fol-
lowing the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can
be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell
takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it
doesn’t expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Rit-
ual, a spellcaster must have it prepared.
Special Abilities. Some characters and monsters
have special abilities that allow them to cast spe-
cific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usu-
ally limited in another way, such as being able to
cast the spell a limited number of times per day.
Magic Items. Spell Scrolls and some other magic
items contain spells that can be cast without a
spell slot. The description of such an item speci-
fies how many times a spell can be cast from it.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is
of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on
the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a
Wizard casts Magic Missile using a level 2 slot, that
Magic Missile is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands
to fill the slot it is put into.

<!-- Page 105 has tables: 7r x 2c (Abjuration, Prevents or rev) -->
	 Some spells, such as Magic Missile and Cure 
Wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a
higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.
School of Magic

Each spell belongs to a school of magic. The schools
are listed in the Schools of Magic table. These cate-
gories help describe spells but have no rules of their
own, although some other rules refer to them.

Schools of Magic

Typical Effects

Abjuration
Prevents or reverses harmful effects

Conjuration

Divination

Enchantment

Evocation

are often destructive

Illusion

Necromancy

Class Spell Lists

If a spell is on a class’s spell list, the class’s name
appears in parentheses after the spell’s school of
magic. Some features add a spell to a character’s
spell list even if the character isn’t a member of a
class in the parentheses.
Casting Time

Most spells require the Magic action to cast, but
some spells require a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or 1
minute or more. A spell’s Casting Time entry speci-
fies which of those is required.

One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn
On a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast
a spell. This rule means you can’t, for example, cast
a spell with a spell slot using the Magic action and
another one using a Bonus Action on the same turn.

Reaction and Bonus Action Triggers
A spell that has a casting time of a Reaction is cast
in response to a trigger that is defined in the spell’s
Casting Time entry. Some spells that have a casting
time of a Bonus Action are also cast in response to a
trigger defined in the spell.

Longer Casting Times
Certain spells—including a spell cast as a Rit-
ual—require more time to cast: minutes or even
hours. While you cast a spell with a casting time of
1 minute or more, you must take the Magic action
on each of your turns, and you must maintain Con-
centration (see “Rules Glossary”) while you do so. If

your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you
don’t expend a spell slot. To cast the spell again, you
must start over.
Range

A spell’s range indicates how far from the spell-
caster the spell’s effect can originate, and the spell’s
description specifies which part of the effect is lim-
ited by the range.
A range usually takes one of the following forms:

Distance. The range is expressed in feet.
Touch. The spell’s effect originates on something,
as defined by the spell, that the spellcaster must
touch within their reach.
Self. The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates
from them, as specified in the spell.

If a spell has movable effects, they aren’t restricted
by its range unless the spell’s description says
otherwise.
Components

A spell’s components are physical requirements the
spellcaster must meet to cast the spell. Each spell’s
description indicates whether it requires Verbal
(V), Somatic (S), or Material (M) components. If the
spellcaster can’t provide one or more of a spell’s
components, the spellcaster can’t cast the spell.

Verbal (V)
A Verbal component is the chanting of esoteric
words that sound like nonsense to the uninitiated.
The words must be uttered in a normal speaking
voice. The words themselves aren’t the source of the
spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of
sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the
threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is
gagged or in an area of magical silence can’t cast a
spell with a Verbal component.

Somatic (S)
A Somatic component is a forceful gesticulation
or an intricate set of gestures. A spellcaster must
use at least one of their hands to perform these
movements.

Material (M)
A Material component is a particular material used
in a spell’s casting, as specified in parentheses in
the Components entry. These materials aren’t con-
sumed by the spell unless the spell’s description
states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand
free to access them, but it can be the same hand
used to perform Somatic components, if any.
If a spell doesn’t consume its materials and
doesn’t specify a cost for them, a spellcaster can use
a Component Pouch (see “Equipment”) instead of
providing the materials specified in the spell, or the

---

spellcaster can substitute a Spellcasting Focus if the
caster has a feature that allows that substitution. To
use a Component Pouch, you must have a hand free
to reach into it, and to use a Spellcasting Focus, you
must hold it unless its description says otherwise
(see “Equipment” for descriptions).
Duration

A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell per-
sists after it is cast. A duration typically takes one of
the following forms:

Concentration. A duration that requires Concen-
tration follows the Concentration rules (see “Rules
Glossary”).
Instantaneous. An instantaneous duration means
the spell’s magic appears only for a moment and
then disappears.
Time Span. A duration that provides a time span
specifies how long the spell lasts in rounds, min-
utes, hours, or the like. For example, a Duration
entry might say “1 minute,” meaning the spell
ends after 1 minute has passed. While a time-span
spell that you cast is ongoing, you can dismiss it
(no action required) if you don’t have the Incapac-
itated condition.
Effects

The effects of a spell are detailed after its dura-
tion entry. Those details present exactly what the
spell does, which ignores mundane physical laws;
any outcomes beyond those effects are under the
GM’s purview. Whatever the effects, they typically
deal with targets, saving throws, attack rolls, or all
three, each of which is detailed below.

Targets
A typical spell requires the caster to pick one or
more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A
spell’s description says whether the spell targets
creatures, objects, or something else.
A Clear Path to the Target. To target something
with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so
it can’t be behind Total Cover.
Targeting Yourself. If a spell targets a creature
of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the
creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature
other than you.
Areas of Effect. Some spells, such as Thunder-
wave, cover an area called an area of effect, which
is defined in “Rules Glossary.” The area determines
what the spell targets. The description of a spell
specifies whether it has an area of effect, which is
typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder,
Emanation, Line, or Sphere.

	 Awareness of Being Targeted. Unless a spell has 
a perceptible effect, a creature doesn’t know it was
targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is ob-
vious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt
to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell’s
description says otherwise.
Invalid Targets. If you cast a spell on someone
or something that can’t be affected by it, nothing
happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to
cast the spell, the slot is still expended.
If the spell normally has no effect on a target that
succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target ap-
pears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even
though it didn’t attempt one (giving no hint that the
creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you per-
ceive that the spell did nothing to the target.

Saving Throws
Many spells specify that a target makes a saving
throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The
spell specifies the ability that the target uses for
the save and what happens on a success or failure.
Here’s how to calculate the DC for your spells:

Spell save DC = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier
+ your Proficiency Bonus

Attack Rolls
Some spells require the caster to make an attack
roll to determine whether the spell hits a target.
Here’s how to calculate the attack modifier for your
spells:

Spell attack modifier = your spellcasting ability
modifier + your Proficiency Bonus

Combining Spell Effects
The effects of different spells add together while
their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of
the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine.
Instead, the most potent effect—such as the high-
est bonus—from those castings applies while their
durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if
the castings are equally potent and their durations
overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast Bless on
the same target, that target gains the spell’s benefit
only once; the target doesn’t receive two bonus dice.
But if the durations of the spells overlap, the effect
continues until the duration of the second Bless
ends.

Identifying an Ongoing Spell

You can try to identify a non-instantaneous spell by
its observable effects if its duration is ongoing. To
identify it, you must take the Study action and suc-
ceed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

Rules Glossary

Glossary Conventions
The glossary uses the following conventions:

Tags in Brackets. Some entries have a tag in brack-
ets after the entry’s name, as in “Attack [Action].”
A tag—Action, Area of Effect, Attitude, Condition,
or Hazard—indicates that a rule is part of a family
of rules. The tags also have glossary entries.
“You.” The game’s rules—in this glossary and else-
where—often talk about something happening
to you in the game world. That “you” refers to
the creature or object that the rule applies to in a
particular moment of play. For example, the “you”
in the Prone condition is a creature that currently
has that condition.
“See Also.” Some glossary entries include a See also
section that points to other entries in the glossary,
to other parts of this document, or both.
No Obsolete Terms. The glossary contains defini-
tions of current rules terms only. If you’re looking
for a term from an earlier version of the fifth edi-
tion rules, consult the index.

Rules Definitions
Here are definitions of various rules.

Ability Check
An ability check is a D20 Test that represents using
one of the six abilities—or a specific skill associated
with an ability—to overcome a challenge. See also
“Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests” and “Proficiency”).

Ability Score and Modifier
A creature has six ability scores—Strength, Dex-
terity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma—each of which has a corresponding mod-
ifier. Add the modifier when you make a D20 Test
with the corresponding ability or when a rule asks
you to do so. See also “Playing the Game” (“The Six
Abilities”).

Action
On your turn, you can take one action. Choose which
action to take from those below or from the special
actions provided by your features. See also “Playing
the Game” (“Actions”). These actions are defined
elsewhere in this glossary:

Attack
Dash
Disengage

Dodge
Help
Hide

Influence
Magic
Ready

Search
Study
Utilize

Advantage
If you have Advantage on a D20 Test, roll two d20s,
and use the higher roll. A roll can’t be affected by
more than one Advantage, and Advantage and Dis-
advantage on the same roll cancel each other. See
also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).

Adventure
An adventure is a series of encounters. A
story emerges through playing them. See also
“Encounter.”

Alignment
A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical
attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of
two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or
neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward
order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). These factors al-
low for nine possible combinations, such as Lawful
Good and Neutral Evil. See also “Character Creation”
(“Create Your Character”).

Ally
A creature is your ally if it is a member of your ad-
venturing party, your friend, on your side in combat,
or a creature that the rules or the GM designates as
your ally.

---

Area of Effect
The descriptions of many spells and other features
specify that they have an area of effect, which typ-
ically has one of six shapes. These shapes are de-
fined elsewhere in this glossary:

Cone
Cube
Cylinder
Emanation
Line
Sphere

An area of effect has a point of origin, a location
from which the effect’s energy erupts. The rules for
each shape specify how to position its point of ori-
gin. If all straight lines extending from the point of
origin to a location in the area of effect are blocked,
that location isn’t included in the area of effect.
To block a line, an obstruction must provide Total
Cover. See also “Cover.”
If the creator of an area of effect places it at an
unseen point and an obstruction—such as a wall—
is between the creator and that point, the point
of origin comes into being on the near side of the
obstruction.

Armor Class
An Armor Class (AC) is the target number for an
attack roll. AC represents how difficult it is to hit a
target.
Your base AC calculation is 10 plus your Dexterity
modifier. If a rule gives you another base AC calcula-
tion, you choose which calculation to use; you can’t
use more than one. See also “Attack Roll.”

Armor Training
Armor training allows you to use armor of a certain
category without the following drawbacks. If you
wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack train-
ing with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test
that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t
cast spells. If you use a Shield and lack training with
it, you don’t gain its AC bonus. See also “Disadvan-
tage” and “Equipment” (“Armor”).

Attack [Action]
When you take the Attack action, you can make one
attack roll with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.
Equipping and Unequipping Weapons. You can
either equip or unequip one weapon when you make
an attack as part of this action. You do so either
before or after the attack. If you equip a weapon
before an attack, you don’t need to use it for that at-
tack. Equipping a weapon includes drawing it from
a sheath or picking it up. Unequipping a weapon in-
cludes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it.
Moving between Attacks. If you move on your
turn and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that
gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack
action, you can use some or all of that movement to
move between those attacks.

Attack Roll
An attack roll is a D20 Test that represents making
an attack with a weapon, an Unarmed Strike, or a
spell. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).

Attitude
A monster has a starting attitude toward a player
character: Friendly, Hostile, or Indifferent. See also
“Friendly,” “Hostile,” “Indifferent,” and “Influence.”

Attunement
Some magic items require a creature to form a
bond—called Attunement—with them before the
creature can use an item’s magical properties. A
creature can have Attunement with no more than
three magic items at a time. See also “Equipment”
(“Magic Items”).

Blinded [Condition]
While you have the Blinded condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Can’t See. You can’t see and automatically fail any
ability check that requires sight.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage.

Blindsight
If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific
range without relying on physical sight. Within that
range, you can see anything that isn’t behind Total
Cover even if you have the Blinded condition or are
in Darkness. Moreover, in that range, you can see
something that has the Invisible condition.

Bloodied
A creature is Bloodied while it has half its Hit Points
or fewer remaining.

Bonus Action
A Bonus Action is a special action that you can take
on the same turn that you take an action. You can’t
take more than one Bonus Action on a turn, and you
have a Bonus Action to take only if a rule explicitly
says so. See also “Playing the Game” (“Actions”).

Breaking Objects
Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some
spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceed-
ingly fragile, the GM may allow a creature to break
it automatically with the Attack or Utilize action.
Armor Class. The Object Armor Class table sug-
gests ACs for various substances.

	 Hit Points. An object is destroyed when it has 0 
Hit Points. The Object Hit Points table suggests Hit
Points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large
or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargan-
tuan object, divide it into Large or smaller sections,
and track each section’s Hit Points separately. The
GM determines whether destroying part of an ob-
ject causes the whole thing to collapse.

	 Damage Types and Objects. Objects have Immu-
nity to Poison and Psychic damage. The GM might
decide that some damage types are more or less ef-
fective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning
damage works well for smashing things but not for
cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have Vulnera-
bility to Fire damage.
Damage Threshold. Big objects, such as castle
walls, often have extra resilience represented by a
damage threshold. See also “Damage Threshold.”
No Ability Scores. An object lacks ability scores
unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without
ability scores, an object can’t make ability checks,
and it fails all saving throws.

Bright Light
Bright Light is normal illumination. See also “Play-
ing the Game” (“Exploration”).

Burning [Hazard]
A burning creature or object takes 1d4 Fire damage
at the start of each of its turns. As an action, you
can extinguish fire on yourself by giving yourself
the Prone condition and rolling on the ground.
The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or
suffocated.

Burrow Speed
A creature that has a Burrow Speed can use that
speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. The
creature can’t burrow through solid rock unless the
creature has a trait that allows it to do so. See also
“Speed.”

Campaign
A campaign is a series of adventures. See also
“Adventure.”

Cantrip
A cantrip is a level 0 spell, which is cast without a
spell slot. See also “Spells.”

Carrying Capacity
Your size and Strength score determine the maxi-
mum weight in pounds that you can carry, as shown
in the Carrying Capacity table. The table also shows
the maximum weight you can drag, lift, or push.
While dragging, lifting, or pushing weight in ex-
cess of the maximum weight you can carry, your
Speed can be no more than 5 feet.

Challenge Rating
Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a
monster poses to a group of four player characters.
Compare a monster’s CR to the characters’ level. If
the CR is higher, the monster is likely a danger. If the
CR is lower, the monster likely poses little threat.
But circumstances and the number of player charac-
ters can significantly alter how threatening a mon-
ster is in actual play. “Gameplay Toolbox” (“Combat
Encounters”) provides guidance to the GM on using
CR while planning potential combat encounters. See
also “Stat Block.”

Character Sheet
A character sheet is a paper or digital record that
you use to track your character’s information. See
also “Character Creation.”

Charmed [Condition]
While you have the Charmed condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Can’t Harm the Charmer. You can’t attack the
charmer or target the charmer with damaging abili-
ties or magical effects.
Social Advantage. The charmer has Advantage on
any ability check to interact with you socially.

Climbing
While you’re climbing, each foot of movement costs
1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). You
ignore this extra cost if you have a Climb Speed and
use it to climb.

---

	 At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery surface or 
one with few handholds might require a successful
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

Climb Speed
A Climb Speed can be used in place of Speed to tra-
verse a vertical surface without expending the extra
movement normally associated with climbing. See
also “Climbing” and “Speed.”

Concentration
Some spells and other effects require Concentration
to remain active, as specified in their descriptions.
If the effect’s creator loses Concentration, the effect
ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the ef-
fect’s description specifies how long the creator can
concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some
other duration. The creator can end Concentration
at any time (no action required). The following fac-
tors break Concentration.
Another Concentration Effect. You lose Concen-
tration on an effect the moment you start casting
a spell that requires Concentration or activate an-
other effect that requires Concentration.
Damage. If you take damage, you must succeed
on a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concen-
tration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken
(round down), whichever number is higher, up to a
maximum DC of 30.
Incapacitated or Dead. Your Concentration ends
if you have the Incapacitated condition or you die.

Condition
A condition is a temporary game state. The defini-
tion of a condition says how it affects its recipient,
and various rules define how to end a condition.
This glossary defines these conditions:

Blinded
Charmed
Deafened
Exhaustion
Frightened

Grappled
Incapacitated
Invisible
Paralyzed
Petrified

Poisoned
Prone
Restrained
Stunned
Unconscious

A condition doesn’t stack with itself; a recipient
either has a condition or doesn’t. The Exhaustion
condition is an exception to that rule.

Cone [Area of Effect]
A Cone is an area of effect that extends in straight
lines from a point of origin in a direction its creator
chooses. A Cone’s width at any point along its length
is equal to that point’s distance from the point of
origin. For example, a Cone is 15 feet wide at a point
along its length that is 15 feet from the point of
origin. The effect that creates a Cone specifies its
maximum length.
A Cone’s point of origin isn’t included in the area
of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

Cover
Cover provides a degree of protection to a target
behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each of
which provides a different benefit to a target: Half
Cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws),
Three-Quarters Cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexter-
ity saving throws), and Total Cover (can’t be tar-
geted directly). If behind more than one degree of
cover, a target benefits only from the most protec-
tive degree. See also “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).

Crawling
While you’re crawling, each foot of movement costs
1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). See
also “Speed.”

Creature
Any being in the game, including a player’s charac-
ter, is a creature. See also “Creature Type.”

Creature Type
Every creature, including every player character,
has a tag in the rules that identifies the type of crea-
ture it is. Most player characters are of the Human-
oid type. These are the game’s creature types:

Monstrosity
Ooze
Plant
Undead

Aberration
Beast
Celestial
Construct
Dragon

Elemental
Fey
Fiend
Giant
Humanoid

The types don’t have rules themselves, but some
rules in the game affect creatures of certain types
in different ways.

Critical Hit
If you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, you
score a Critical Hit, and the attack hits regardless of
any modifiers or the target’s AC. A Critical Hit lets
you roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against
the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice
and add them together. Then add any relevant mod-
ifiers. See also “Playing the Game” (“Damage and
Healing”).

Cube [Area of Effect]
A Cube is an area of effect that extends in straight
lines from a point of origin located anywhere on a
face of the Cube. The effect that creates a Cube spec-
ifies its size, which is the length of each side.
A Cube’s point of origin isn’t included in the area
of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

Curses
Some game effects curse a creature or an object.
The effect that confers a curse defines what the
curse does. Curses can be removed by the Remove
Curse and Greater Restoration spells or other magic
that explicitly ends curses.

---


<!-- Page 180 has tables: 7r x 2c (Necrotic, Life-draining e); 5r x 2c (Acid, Corrosive liqui) -->
Cylinder [Area of Effect]
A Cylinder is an area of effect that extends in
straight lines from a point of origin located at the
center of the circular top or bottom of the Cylinder.
The effect that creates a Cylinder specifies the ra-
dius of the Cylinder’s base and the Cylinder’s height.
A Cylinder’s point of origin is included in the area
of effect.

D20 Test
D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of
the game: ability checks, attack rolls, and saving
throws. If something in the game affects D20 Tests,
it affects all three of these rolls. The GM determines
whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circum-
stance. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).

Damage
Damage represents harm that causes a creature or
an object to lose Hit Points.

Damage Roll
A damage roll is a die roll, adjusted by any applica-
ble modifiers, that deals damage to a target. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

Damage Threshold
A creature or an object that has a damage thresh-
old has Immunity to all damage unless it takes an
amount of damage from a single attack or effect
equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in
which case it takes that entire instance of dam-
age. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the
damage threshold is superficial and doesn’t reduce
Hit Points. For example, if an object has a damage
threshold of 10, the object takes no damage if 9
damage is dealt to it, since that damage fails to
exceed the threshold. If the same object is dealt 11
damage, it takes all of that damage.

Damage Types
Attacks and other harmful effects deal different
types of damage. Damage types have no rules of
their own, but other rules, such as Resistance, rely
on the types. The Damage Types table offers exam-
ples to help a GM assign a type to a new effect.

Damage Types

Type
Examples

Acid
Corrosive liquids, digestive enzymes

Bludgeoning
Blunt objects, constriction, falling

Cold
Freezing water, icy blasts

Fire
Flames, unbearable heat

Force
Pure magical energy

Lightning
Electricity

Type
Examples

Necrotic
Life-draining energy

Piercing
Fangs, puncturing objects

Poison
Toxic gas, venom

Psychic
Mind-rending energy

Radiant
Holy energy, searing radiation

Slashing
Claws, cutting objects

Thunder
Concussive sound

Darkness
An area of Darkness is Heavily Obscured. See
also “Heavily Obscured” and “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).

Darkvision
If you have Darkvision, you can see in Dim Light
within a specified range as if it were Bright Light
and in Darkness within that range as if it were
Dim Light. You discern colors in that Darkness
only as shades of gray. See also “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).

Dash [Action]
When you take the Dash action, you gain extra
movement for the current turn. The increase equals
your Speed after applying any modifiers. With a
Speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to
60 feet on your turn if you Dash. If your Speed of 30
feet is reduced to 15 feet, you can move up to 30 feet
this turn if you Dash.
If you have a special speed, such as a Fly Speed or
Swim Speed, you can use that speed instead of your
Speed when you take this action. You choose which
speed to use each time you take it. See also “Speed.”

Dead
A dead creature has no Hit Points and can’t regain
them unless it is first revived by magic such as the
Raise Dead or Revivify spell. When such a spell is
cast, the spirit knows who is casting it and can re-
fuse. The spirit of a dead creature has left the body
and departed for the Outer Planes, and reviving the
creature requires calling the spirit back.
If the creature returns to life, the revival effect
determines the creature’s current Hit Points. Un-
less otherwise stated, the creature returns to life
with any conditions, magical contagions, or curses
that were affecting it at death if the durations of
those effects are still ongoing. If the creature died
with any Exhaustion levels, it returns with 1 fewer
level. If the creature had Attunement to one or more
magic items, it is no longer attuned to them.

<!-- Page 181 has tables: 3r x 2c (Tiny, 1/4 gallon); 3r x 2c (Large, 4 gallons) -->
Deafened [Condition]
While you have the Deafened condition, you experi-
ence the following effect.
Can’t Hear. You can’t hear and automatically fail
any ability check that requires hearing.

Death Saving Throw
A player character must make a Death Saving
Throw (also called a Death Save) if they start their
turn with 0 Hit Points. See also “Playing the Game”
(“Damage and Healing”).

Dehydration [Hazard]
A creature requires an amount of water per day
based on its size, as shown in the Water Needs per
Day table. A creature that drinks less than half the
required water for a day gains 1 Exhaustion level
at the day’s end. Exhaustion caused by dehydra-
tion can’t be removed until the creature drinks the
full amount of water required for a day. See also
“Exhaustion.”

Water Needs per Day

Size

Difficult Terrain
If a space is Difficult Terrain, every foot of move-
ment in that space costs 1 extra foot. For example,
moving 5 feet through Difficult Terrain costs 10 feet
of movement. Difficult Terrain isn’t cumulative; ei-
ther a space is Difficult Terrain or it isn’t.
A space is Difficult Terrain if the space contains
any of the following or something similar:

•	A creature that isn’t Tiny or your ally
•	Furniture that is sized for creatures of your size or
larger
•	Heavy snow, ice, rubble, or undergrowth
•	Liquid that’s between shin- and waist-deep
•	A narrow opening sized for a creature one size
smaller than you
•	A slope of 20 degrees or more

Difficulty Class
A Difficulty Class (DC) is the target number for an
ability check or a saving throw. See also “Playing the
Game” (“D20 Tests”).

Dim Light
An area with Dim Light is Lightly Obscured. See
also “Lightly Obscured” and “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).

Disadvantage
If you have Disadvantage on a D20 Test, roll two
d20s and use the lower roll. A roll can’t be affected
by more than one Disadvantage, and Advantage and
Disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other. See
also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).

Disengage [Action]
If you take the Disengage action, your movement
doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of
the current turn.

Dodge [Action]
If you take the Dodge action, you gain the following
benefits: until the start of your next turn, any attack
roll made against you has Disadvantage if you can
see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving
throws with Advantage.
You lose these benefits if you have the Incapaci-
tated condition or if your Speed is 0.

Emanation [Area of Effect]
An Emanation is an area of effect that extends in
straight lines from a creature or an object in all di-
rections. The effect that creates an Emanation spec-
ifies the distance it extends.
An Emanation moves with the creature or object
that is its origin unless it is an instantaneous or a
stationary effect.
An Emanation’s origin (creature or object) isn’t
included in the area of effect unless its creator de-
cides otherwise.

Encounter
An encounter is a scene in an adventure that is part
of at least one of the game’s three pillars: social in-
teraction, exploration, or combat. See also “Playing
the Game” (“Social Interaction,” “Exploration,” and
“Combat”).

Enemy
A creature is your enemy if it fights against you in
combat, actively works to harm you, or is desig-
nated as your enemy by the rules or GM.

Exhaustion [Condition]
While you have the Exhaustion condition, you
experience the following effects.
Exhaustion Levels. This condition is cumulative.
Each time you receive it, you gain 1 Exhaustion
level. You die if your Exhaustion level is 6.
D20 Tests Affected. When you make a D20 Test,
the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.
Speed Reduced. Your Speed is reduced by a num-
ber of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.
Removing Exhaustion Levels. Finishing a Long
Rest removes 1 of your Exhaustion levels. When
your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.

---

Experience Points
As they overcome challenges and complete ad-
ventures, characters earn Experience Points (XP),
which are awarded by the Game Master. When a
character’s XP total crosses certain thresholds,
the character’s level increases. See also “Level
Advancement.”

Expertise
Expertise is a feature that enhances your use of a
skill proficiency. When you make an ability check
with a skill proficiency in which you have Expertise,
your Proficiency Bonus is doubled for that check un-
less the bonus is doubled by another feature.
If you gain Expertise, you gain it in one skill in
which you have proficiency. You can’t have Exper-
tise in the same skill proficiency more than once.
See also “Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).

Falling [Hazard]
A creature that falls takes 1d6 Bludgeoning dam-
age at the end of the fall for every 10 feet it fell, to
a maximum of 20d6. When the creature lands, it
has the Prone condition unless it avoids taking any
damage from the fall.
A creature that falls into water or another liquid
can use its Reaction to make a DC 15 Strength (Ath-
letics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hit the
surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any
damage resulting from the fall is halved.

Flying
A variety of effects allow a creature to fly. While fly-
ing, you fall if you have the Incapacitated or Prone
condition or your Fly Speed is reduced to 0. You can
stay aloft in those circumstances if you can hover.
See also “Falling” and “Fly Speed.”

Fly Speed
A Fly Speed can be used to travel through the air.
While you have a Fly Speed, you can stay aloft until
you land, fall, or die. See also “Flying” and “Speed.”

Friendly [Attitude]
A Friendly creature views you favorably. You
have Advantage on an ability check to influence a
Friendly creature. See also “Influence.”

Frightened [Condition]
While you have the Frightened condition, you expe-
rience the following effects.
Ability Checks and Attacks Affected. You have
Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls
while the source of fear is within line of sight.
Can’t Approach. You can’t willingly move closer to
the source of fear.

Grappled [Condition]
While you have the Grappled condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Attacks Affected. You have Disadvantage on at-
tack rolls against any target other than the grappler.
Movable. The grappler can drag or carry you
when it moves, but every foot of movement costs it 1
extra foot unless you are Tiny or two or more sizes
smaller than it.

Grappling
A creature can grapple another creature. Charac-
ters typically grapple by using an Unarmed Strike.
Many monsters have special attacks that allow
them to quickly grapple prey. However a grapple is
initiated, it follows these rules. See also “Unarmed
Strike” and “Grappled.”
Grappled Condition. Successfully grappling a
creature gives it the Grappled condition.
One Grapple per Hand. A creature must have a
hand free to grapple another creature. Some stat
blocks and game effects allow a creature to grapple
using a tentacle, a maw, or another body part. What-
ever part a grappler uses, it can grapple only one
creature at a time with that part, and the grappler
can’t use that part to target another creature unless
it ends the grapple.
Ending a Grapple. A Grappled creature can use
its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexter-
ity (Acrobatics) check against the grapple’s escape
DC, ending the condition on itself on a success. The
condition also ends if the grappler has the Inca-
pacitated condition or if the distance between the
Grappled target and the grappler exceeds the grap-
ple’s range. In addition, the grappler can release the
target at any time (no action required).

Hazard
A hazard is an environmental danger. See also
“Burning,” “Dehydration,” “Falling,” “Malnutrition,”
and “Suffocation.”

Healing
Healing is how you regain Hit Points. See also “Play-
ing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

Heavily Obscured
You have the Blinded condition while trying to see
something in a Heavily Obscured space. See also
“Blinded,” “Darkness,” and “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).

Help [Action]
When you take the Help action, you do one of the
following.
Assist an Ability Check. Choose one of your
skill or tool proficiencies and one ally who is near

---

enough for you to assist verbally or physically when
they make an ability check. That ally has Advantage
on the next ability check they make with the chosen
skill or tool. This benefit expires if the ally doesn’t
use it before the start of your next turn. The GM has
final say on whether your assistance is possible.
Assist an Attack Roll. You momentarily distract
an enemy within 5 feet of you, giving Advantage to
the next attack roll by one of your allies against that
enemy. This benefit expires at the start of your next
turn.

Heroic Inspiration
If you (a player character) have Heroic Inspiration,
you can expend it to reroll any die immediately af-
ter rolling it, and you must use the new roll.
If you gain Heroic Inspiration but already have it,
it’s lost unless you give it to a player character who
lacks it.

Hide [Action]
With the Hide action, you try to hide yourself. To do
so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth)
check while you’re Heavily Obscured or behind
Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover, and you must
be out of any enemy’s line of sight; if you can see a
creature, you can discern whether it can see you.
On a successful check, you have the Invisible con-
dition while hidden. Make note of your check’s total,
which is the DC for a creature to find you with a
Wisdom (Perception) check.
You stop being hidden immediately after any of
the following occurs: you make a sound louder than
a whisper, an enemy finds you, you make an attack
roll, or you cast a spell with a Verbal component.

High Jump
When you make a High Jump, you leap into the
air a number of feet equal to 3 plus your Strength
modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least
10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When
you make a standing High Jump, you can jump only
half that distance. Either way, each foot of the jump
costs a foot of movement.
You can extend your arms half your height above
yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach a dis-
tance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times
your height.

Hit Point Dice
Hit Point Dice, or Hit Dice for short, help determine
a player character’s Hit Point maximum, as ex-
plained in “Character Creation.” Most monsters also
have Hit Dice. A creature can spend Hit Dice during
a Short Rest to regain Hit Points. See also “Short
Rest.”

Hit Points
Hit Points (HP) are a measure of how difficult it is
to kill or destroy a creature or an object. Damage
reduces Hit Points, and healing restores them.
You can’t have more Hit Points than your Hit Point
maximum, and you can’t have less than 0. See also
“Breaking Objects” and “Playing the Game” (“Dam-
age and Healing”).

Hostile [Attitude]
A Hostile creature views you unfavorably. You have
Disadvantage on an ability check to influence a Hos-
tile creature. See also “Influence.”

Hover
Some creatures can hover, as noted in their stat
blocks, and some spells and other effects grant the
ability to hover. Hovering while flying prevents
you from falling in certain circumstances. See also
“Flying.”

Illusions
Spells and other effects sometimes create magical il-
lusions. Such an effect defines what the illusion does
and which senses or mental faculties it deceives.
If an illusion manifests in space, the illusion is
insubstantial and weightless, yet it seems to be
affected by the environment as if the illusion were
real unless the effect that created it specifies oth-
erwise. For example, a visual illusion of a creature
casts shadows and reflections, and wind appears
to affect the illusory creature. Similarly, an audible
illusion echoes in an echoey space.

Immunity
If you have Immunity to a damage type or a condi-
tion, it doesn’t affect you in any way.

Improvised Weapons
An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a
makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg,
or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also
counts as an improvised weapon if it’s wielded in
a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged
weapon to make a melee attack or throw a Me-
lee weapon that lacks the Thrown property, the
weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An impro-
vised weapon follows the rules below.
Proficiency. Don’t add your Proficiency Bonus to
attack rolls with an improvised weapon.
Damage. On a hit, the weapon deals 1d4 damage
of a type the GM thinks is appropriate for the object.
Range. If you throw the weapon, it has a normal
range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
Weapon Equivalents. If an improvised weapon
resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the GM may
say it functions as that weapon and uses that weap-
on’s rules. For example, the GM could treat a table
leg as a Club.

Incapacitated [Condition]
While you have the Incapacitated condition, you ex-
perience the following effects.
Inactive. You can’t take any action, Bonus Action,
or Reaction.
No Concentration. Your Concentration is broken.
Speechless. You can’t speak.
Surprised. If you’re Incapacitated when you roll
Initiative, you have Disadvantage on the roll.

Indifferent [Attitude]
An Indifferent creature has no desire to help or hin-
der you. Indifferent is the default attitude of a mon-
ster. See also “Influence.”

Influence [Action]
With the Influence action, you urge a monster to
do something. Describe or roleplay how you’re
communicating with the monster. Are you trying to
deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade? The
GM then determines whether the monster feels will-
ing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction;
this determination establishes whether an ability
check is necessary, as explained below.
Willing. If your urging aligns with the monster’s
desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster
fulfills your request in a way it prefers.
Unwilling. If your urging is repugnant to the mon-
ster or counter to its alignment, no ability check is
necessary; it doesn’t comply.
Hesitant. If you urge the monster to do something
that it is hesitant to do, you must make an ability
check, which is affected by the monster’s attitude:
Indifferent, Friendly, or Hostile, each of which is
defined in this glossary. The Influence Checks ta-
ble suggests which ability check to make based on
how you’re interacting with the monster. The GM
chooses the check, which has a default DC equal to
15 or the monster’s Intelligence score, whichever
is higher. On a successful check, the monster does
as urged. On a failed check, you must wait 24 hours
(or a duration set by the GM) before urging it in the
same way again.

Influence Checks

Ability Check
Interaction

Charisma (Deception)
Deceiving a monster
that understands you

Charisma (Intimidation)
Intimidating a monster

Charisma (Performance)
Amusing a monster

Charisma (Persuasion)
Persuading a monster
that understands you

Wisdom (Animal Handling)
Gently coaxing a Beast
or Monstrosity

Initiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during com-
bat. The combat rules in “Playing the Game” explain
how to roll Initiative.
Sometimes a GM might have combatants use
their Initiative scores instead of rolling Initiative.
Your Initiative score equals 10 plus your Dexterity
modifier. If you have Advantage on Initiative rolls,
increase your Initiative score by 5. If you have Dis-
advantage on those rolls, decrease that score by 5.
See also “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).

Invisible [Condition]
While you have the Invisible condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Surprise. If you’re Invisible when you roll Initia-
tive, you have Advantage on the roll.
Concealed. You aren’t affected by any effect that
requires its target to be seen unless the effect’s cre-
ator can somehow see you. Any equipment you are
wearing or carrying is also concealed.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Disadvantage, and your attack rolls have Advan-
tage. If a creature can somehow see you, you don’t
gain this benefit against that creature.

Jumping
When you jump, you make either a Long Jump (hor-
izontal) or a High Jump (vertical). See also “Long
Jump” and “High Jump.”

Knocking Out a Creature
When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points
with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the
creature to 1 Hit Point. The creature then has the
Unconscious condition and starts a Short Rest.
The creature remains Unconscious until it regains
any Hit Points or until someone uses an action to
administer first aid to it, which requires a success-
ful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

Lightly Obscured
You have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks to see something in a Lightly Obscured
space. See also “Dim Light” and “Playing the Game”
(“Exploration”).

Line [Area of Effect]
A Line is an area of effect that extends from a point
of origin in a straight path along its length and cov-
ers an area defined by its width. The effect that cre-
ates a Line specifies its length and width.
A Line’s point of origin isn’t included in the area of
effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

Long Jump
When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally
a number of feet up to your Strength score if you

---

move at least 10 feet immediately before the jump.
When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap
only half that distance. Either way, each foot you
jump costs a foot of movement.
If you land in Difficult Terrain, you must succeed
on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or have the
Prone condition.
This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of
the jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a
stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must suc-
ceed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a
low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s
distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise,
you hit the obstacle.

Long Rest
A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime—at
least 8 hours—available to any creature. During a
Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and per-
form no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as
reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.
During sleep, you have the Unconscious condition.
After you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least
16 hours before starting another one.
Benefits of the Rest. To start a Long Rest, you
must have at least 1 Hit Point. When you finish the
rest, you gain the following benefits:

Regain All HP. You regain all lost Hit Points and all
spent Hit Point Dice. If your Hit Point maximum
was reduced, it returns to normal.
Ability Scores Restored. If any of your ability
scores were reduced, they return to normal.
Exhaustion Reduced. If you have the Exhaustion
condition, its level decreases by 1.
Special Feature. Some features are recharged by a
Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges
in the way specified in its description.

	 Interrupting the Rest. A Long Rest is stopped by 
the following interruptions:

•	 Rolling Initiative
•	 Casting a spell other than a cantrip
•	 Taking any damage
•	 1 hour of walking or other physical exertion

If you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption,
you gain the benefits of a Short Rest. See also “Short
Rest.”
You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an
interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 addi-
tional hour per interruption to finish.

Magic [Action]
When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell
that has a casting time of an action or use a feature
or magic item that requires a Magic action to be
activated.

	 If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 min-
ute or longer, you must take the Magic action on
each turn of that casting, and you must maintain
Concentration while you do so. If your Concentra-
tion is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a
spell slot. See also “Concentration.”

Magical Effect
An effect is magical if it is created by a spell, a magic
item, or a phenomenon that a rule labels as magical.

Malnutrition [Hazard]
A creature needs an amount of food per day based
on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day ta-
ble. A creature that eats but consumes less than half
the required food for a day must succeed on a DC
10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion
level at the day’s end. A creature that eats nothing
for 5 days automatically gains 1 Exhaustion level at
the end of the fifth day as well as an additional level
at the end of each subsequent day without food.
Exhaustion caused by malnutrition can’t be re-
moved until the creature eats the full amount of
food required for a day. See also “Exhaustion.”

Food Needs per Day

Size
Food
Size
Food

Tiny
1/4 pound
Large
4 pounds

Small

Monster
A monster is a creature controlled by the GM, even
if the creature is benevolent. See also “Creature” and
“NPC.”

Nonplayer Character
A nonplayer character (NPC) is a monster that has
a personal name and a distinct personality. See also
“Monster.”

Object
An object is a nonliving, distinct thing. Composite
things, like buildings, comprise more than one ob-
ject. See also “Breaking Objects.”

Occupied Space
A space is occupied if a creature is in it or if it is
completely filled by objects.

Opportunity Attacks
You can make an Opportunity Attack when a crea-
ture that you can see leaves your reach using its
action, its Bonus Action, its Reaction, or one of its
speeds. To make the Opportunity Attack, take a Re-
action to make one melee attack with a weapon or
an Unarmed Strike against the provoking creature.
The attack occurs right before the creature leaves
your reach. See also “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).

---

Paralyzed [Condition]
While you have the Paralyzed condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Incapacitated. You have the Incapacitated
condition.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage.
Automatic Critical Hits. Any attack roll that hits
you is a Critical Hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of
you.

Passive Perception
Passive Perception is a score that reflects a crea-
ture’s general awareness of its surroundings. The
GM uses this score when determining whether a
creature notices something without consciously
making a Wisdom (Perception) check.
A creature’s Passive Perception equals 10 plus the
creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check bonus. If the
creature has Advantage on such checks, increase
the score by 5. If the creature has Disadvantage on
them, decrease the score by 5. For example, a level
1 character with a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in
Perception has a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 +
2). If that character has Advantage on Wisdom (Per-
ception) checks, the score becomes 19.

Per Day
If a rule says you can use something a certain num-
ber of times per day, that means you must finish a
Long Rest to use it again after you run out of uses.

Petrified [Condition]
While you have the Petrified condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Turned to Inanimate Substance. You are trans-
formed, along with any nonmagical objects you are
wearing and carrying, into a solid inanimate sub-
stance (usually stone). Your weight increases by a
factor of ten, and you cease aging.
Incapacitated. You have the Incapacitated
condition.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage.
Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
Resist Damage. You have Resistance to all
damage.
Poison Immunity. You have Immunity to the Poi-
soned condition.

Player Character
A player character is a character controlled by a
player. See also “Character Creation.”

Poisoned [Condition]
While you have the Poisoned condition, you experi-
ence the following effect.
Ability Checks and Attacks Affected. You have
Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

Possession
Some effects cause a creature to be possessed by
another creature or entity. A possessing effect de-
fines how the possession operates. Possession can
be prevented by the Protection from Evil and Good
spell and ended by the Dispel Evil and Good spell.

Proficiency
If you have proficiency with something, you can add
your Proficiency Bonus to any D20 Test you make
using that thing. A creature might have proficiency
in a skill or saving throw or with a weapon or tool.
See also “Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).

Prone [Condition]
While you have the Prone condition, you experience
the following effects.
Restricted Movement. Your only movement op-
tions are to crawl or to spend an amount of move-
ment equal to half your Speed (round down) to
right yourself and thereby end the condition. If your
Speed is 0, you can’t right yourself.
Attacks Affected. You have Disadvantage on at-
tack rolls. An attack roll against you has Advantage
if the attacker is within 5 feet of you. Otherwise,
that attack roll has Disadvantage.

Reach
A creature has a reach of 5 feet unless a rule says
otherwise.

Reaction
A Reaction is a special action taken in response to
a trigger defined in the Reaction’s description. You
can take a Reaction on another creature’s turn, and
if you take it on your turn, you can do so even if you
also take an action, a Bonus Action, or both. Once
you take a Reaction, you can’t take another one
until the start of your next turn. The Opportunity
Attack is a Reaction available to all creatures. See
also “Opportunity Attacks” and “Playing the Game”
(“Actions”).

Ready [Action]
You take the Ready action to wait for a particular
circumstance before you act. To do so, you take this
action on your turn, which lets you act by taking a
Reaction before the start of your next turn.
First, you decide what perceivable circumstance
will trigger your Reaction. Then, you choose the
action you will take in response to that trigger, or
you choose to move up to your Speed in response
to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the

---


<!-- Page 187 has tables: 3r x 2c (Insight, Creature’s stat) -->
trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the
zombie steps next to me, I move away.”
When the trigger occurs, you can either take your
Reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore
the trigger.
When you Ready a spell, you cast it as normal (ex-
pending any resources used to cast it) but hold its
energy, which you release with your Reaction when
the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have
a casting time of an action, and holding on to the
spell’s magic requires Concentration, which you can
maintain up to the start of your next turn. If your
Concentration is broken, the spell dissipates with-
out taking effect.

Resistance
If you have Resistance to a damage type, damage
of that type is halved against you (round down).
Resistance is applied only once to an instance of
damage. See also “Playing the Game” (“Damage and
Healing”).

Restrained [Condition]
While you have the Restrained condition, you expe-
rience the following effects.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage.
Saving Throws Affected. You have Disadvantage
on Dexterity saving throws.

Ritual
If you have a spell prepared that has the Ritual tag,
you can cast that spell as a Ritual. The Ritual ver-
sion of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than
normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which
means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a
higher level. See also “Spells.”

Round Down
Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the
game, round down if you end up with a fraction,
even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some
rules make an exception and tell you to round up.

Save
Save is another name for a saving throw. See also
“Saving Throw.”

Saving Throw
A saving throw—also called a save—represents an
attempt to avoid or resist a threat. You normally
make a saving throw only when a rule requires you
to do so, but you can decide to fail the save without
rolling. The result of a save is detailed in the effect
that allowed it. If a target is forced to make a save
and lacks the ability score used by it, the target au-
tomatically fails. See also “Playing the Game” (“D20
Tests”).

Search [Action]
When you take the Search action, you make a Wis-
dom check to discern something that isn’t obvious.
The Search table suggests which skills are applica-
ble when you take this action, depending on what
you’re trying to detect.

Search

Skill
Thing to Detect

Insight
Creature’s state of mind

Medicine
Creature’s ailment or cause of death

Perception
Concealed creature or object

Survival
Tracks or food

Shape-Shifting
If an effect, such as Wild Shape or the Polymorph
spell, lets you shape-shift, its description specifies
what happens to you. Unless that description says
otherwise, any ongoing effects on you—conditions,
spells, curses, and the like—carry over from one
form to the other. You revert to your true form if
you die.

Short Rest
A Short Rest is a 1-hour period of downtime, during
which a creature does nothing more strenuous than
reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. To start
a Short Rest, you must have at least 1 Hit Point.
Benefits of the Rest. When you finish the rest, you
gain the following benefits:

Spend Hit Point Dice. You can spend one or more
of your Hit Point Dice to regain Hit Points. For
each Hit Point Die you spend in this way, roll the
die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You
regain Hit Points equal to the total (minimum of 1
Hit Point). You can decide to spend an additional
Hit Point Die after each roll.
Special Feature. Some features are recharged by a
Short Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges
in the way specified in its description.

	 Interrupting the Rest. A Short Rest is stopped by 
the following interruptions:

•	 Rolling Initiative
•	 Casting a spell other than a cantrip
•	 Taking any damage

An interrupted Short Rest confers no benefits.

Simultaneous Effects
If two or more things happen at the same time on a
turn, the person at the game table—player or GM—
whose turn it is decides the order in which those
things happen. For example, if two effects occur at
the start of a player character’s turn, the player de-
cides which of the effects happens first.

---

Size
A creature or an object belongs to a size category:
Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan.
A creature’s size determines how much space the
creature occupies in combat. An object’s size affects
its Hit Points. See also “Breaking Objects” and “Play-
ing the Game” (“Combat”).

Skill
A skill is an area of specialization associated with
an ability check. If you have proficiency in a skill,
you can add your Proficiency Bonus when you make
an ability check associated with that skill. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).

Speed
A creature has a Speed, which is the distance in feet
the creature can cover when it moves on its turn.
See also “Climbing,” “Crawling,” “Flying,” “Jumping,”
“Swimming” and “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).
Special Speeds. Some creatures have special
speeds, such as a Burrow Speed, Climb Speed, Fly
Speed, or Swim Speed, each of which is defined
in this glossary. If you have more than one speed,
choose which one to use when you move; you can
switch between the speeds during your move.
Whenever you switch, subtract the distance already
moved from the new speed. The result determines
how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or
less, you can’t use the new speed during the current
move. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 and a
Fly Speed of 40, you could fly 10 feet, walk 10 feet,
and leap into the air to fly 20 feet more.
Changes to Your Speeds. If an effect increases or
decreases your Speed for a time, any special speed
you have increases or decreases by an equal amount
for the same duration. For example, if your Speed
is reduced to 0 and you have a Climb Speed, your
Climb Speed is also reduced to 0. Similarly, if your
Speed is halved and you have a Fly Speed, your Fly
Speed is also halved.

Spell
A spell is a magical effect that has the characteris-
tics described in “Spells.”

Spell Attack
A spell attack is an attack roll made as part of a spell
or another magical effect. See also “Spells” (“Casting
Spells”).

Spellcasting Focus
A Spellcasting Focus is an object that certain crea-
tures can use in place of a spell’s Material compo-
nents if those materials aren’t consumed by the
spell and don’t have a cost specified. Some classes
allow its members to use certain types of Spellcast-
ing Focuses. See also “Spells” (“Casting Spells”).

Sphere [Area of Effect]
A Sphere is an area of effect that extends in straight
lines from a point of origin outward in all direc-
tions. The effect that creates a Sphere specifies the
distance it extends as the radius of the Sphere.
A Sphere’s point of origin is included in the
Sphere’s area of effect.

Stable
A creature is Stable if it has 0 Hit Points but isn’t
required to make Death Saving Throws. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

Stat Block
A stat block contains the game statistics of a mon-
ster. Each stat block includes the following informa-
tion presented after the monster’s name.
Size. A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large,
Huge, or Gargantuan. See also “Size.”
Creature Type. This entry notes the family of be-
ings a monster belongs to, along with any descrip-
tive tags. See also “Creature Type.”
Alignment. An alignment is suggested for the
monster, with the GM determining its actual align-
ment. See also “Alignment.”
AC, Initiative, and HP. These entries give the
monster’s Armor Class, Initiative, and Hit Points,
which are detailed in “Playing the Game.” In paren-
theses after the Hit Points, the monster’s Hit Point
Dice are provided, along with the contribution of its
Constitution, if any, to its Hit Points. Following the
Initiative modifier is an Initiative score. Some crea-
tures that are created by magic lack Hit Dice and
Initiative information.
Speed. Here the monster’s Speed is provided,
along with any special speeds. See also “Burrow
Speed,” “Climb Speed,” “Fly Speed,” and “Swim
Speed.”
Ability Scores. A table provides the monster’s
ability scores, modifiers, and saving throw modifi-
ers, all of which are detailed in “Playing the Game.”
Skills. This entry lists the monster’s skill pro-
ficiencies, if any. See also “Playing the Game”
(“Proficiency”).
Resistances and Vulnerabilities. These entries
list the monster’s Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if
any. See also “Resistance” and “Vulnerability.”
Immunities. This section lists the monster’s
damage and condition Immunities, if any. See also
“Immunity.”
Gear. If the monster has any equipment that can
be given away or retrieved, it’s listed in this entry.
Senses. This entry lists the monster’s special
senses, such as Darkvision, and its Passive Percep-
tion. See also “Passive Perception.”
Languages. This entry lists any languages the
monster knows.

---


<!-- Page 189 has tables: 5r x 2c (Arcana, Spells, magic i) -->
	 CR. Challenge Rating summarizes the threat a 
monster poses and is detailed in “Monsters.” The
Experience Points characters receive for defeating
a monster and its Proficiency Bonus follow. Some
creatures that are created by magic have no CR. See
also “Challenge Rating” and “Experience Points.”
Traits. The monster’s traits, if any, are features
that are active at all times or in certain situations.
Actions. The monster can take these actions in
addition to those detailed in this glossary. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Actions”).
Bonus Actions. If the monster has Bonus Action
options, they are listed in this section.
Reactions. If the monster can take special Reac-
tions, those are listed in this section.
Attack Notation. The entry for a monster’s attack
starts by identifying whether the attack is a melee
or a ranged attack and then provides the attack
roll’s bonus, its reach or range, and what happens
on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its
entry says otherwise.
Saving Throw Effect Notation. If an effect forces
a saving throw, the effect’s entry starts by identify-
ing the kind of saving throw required and then pro-
vides the save’s DC, a description of which creatures
must make the save, and what happens on a failed
or a successful save.
Damage Notation. A stat block usually provides
both a static number and a die expression for each
instance of damage. For example, an attack might
deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit. The GM deter-
mines whether you use the static number or the die
expression in parentheses; you don’t use both.

Study [Action]
When you take the Study action, you make an Intel-
ligence check to study your memory, a book, a clue,
or another source of knowledge and call to mind an
important piece of information about it.
The Areas of Knowledge table suggests which
skills are applicable to various areas of knowledge.

Areas of Knowledge

Skill
Areas

Arcana
Spells, magic items, eldritch symbols,
magical traditions, planes of existence,
and certain creatures (Aberrations,
Constructs, Elementals, Fey, and
Monstrosities)

History
Historic events and people, ancient
civilizations, wars, and certain creatures
(Giants and Humanoids)

Investigation
Traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry

Nature
Terrain, flora, weather, and certain
creatures (Beasts, Dragons, Oozes, and
Plants)

Religion
Deities, religious hierarchies and rites,
holy symbols, cults, and certain crea-
tures (Celestials, Fiends, and Undead)

Stunned [Condition]
While you have the Stunned condition, you experi-
ence the following effects.
Incapacitated. You have the Incapacitated
condition.
Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage.

Suffocation [Hazard]
A creature can hold its breath for a number of
minutes equal to 1 plus its Constitution modifier
(minimum of 30 seconds) before suffocation begins.
When a creature runs out of breath or is choking,
it gains 1 Exhaustion level at the end of each of
its turns. When a creature can breathe again, it
removes all levels of Exhaustion it gained from
suffocating.

Surprise
If a creature is caught unawares by the start of
combat, that creature is surprised, which causes it
to have Disadvantage on its Initiative roll. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Combat”).

Swimming
While you’re swimming, each foot of movement
costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain).
You ignore this extra cost if you have a Swim Speed
and use it to swim. At the GM’s option, moving any
distance in rough water might require a successful
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

Swim Speed
A Swim Speed can be used to swim without expend-
ing the extra movement normally associated with
swimming. See also “Swimming” and “Speed.”

---

Target
A target is the creature or object targeted by an
attack roll, forced to make a saving throw by an
effect, or selected to receive the effects of a spell or
another phenomenon.

Telepathy
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature
to communicate mentally with another creature
within a specified range. Unless a rule states other-
wise, the contacted creature doesn’t need to share a
language with the telepath to understand this com-
munication, but the contacted creature must be able
to understand at least one language or be telepathic
itself to understand.
A telepath doesn’t need to see a contacted crea-
ture, and the telepath can start or end the telepathic
contact at any time (no action required). Telepathic
contact can’t be initiated and is immediately broken
if either the telepath or the other creature has the
Incapacitated condition. Telepathic contact is also
broken if the contacted creature is no longer within
the telepathy’s range or if the telepath contacts a
different creature within range.
A creature without telepathy can receive tele-
pathic messages but can’t initiate a telepathic con-
versation. Once a telepathic conversation starts,
the non-telepath can communicate mentally to the
telepath until the telepathic connection ends.

Teleportation
Teleportation is a special kind of magical transpor-
tation. If you teleport, you disappear and reappear
elsewhere instantly, without moving through the
intervening space. This transportation doesn’t ex-
pend movement unless a rule tells you otherwise,
and teleportation never provokes Opportunity
Attacks.
When you teleport, all the equipment you’re
wearing and carrying teleports with you. If you’re
touching another creature when you teleport, that
creature doesn’t teleport with you unless the tele-
portation effect says otherwise.
If the destination space of your teleportation is
occupied by another creature or blocked by a solid
obstacle, you instead appear in the nearest unoccu-
pied space of your choice.
The description of a teleportation effect tells you
if you must see the teleportation’s destination.

Temporary Hit Points
Temporary Hit Points are granted by certain effects
and act as a buffer against losing real Hit Points. See
also “Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

Tremorsense
A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the loca-
tion of creatures and moving objects within a spe-
cific range, provided that the creature with Trem-
orsense and anything it is detecting are both in
contact with the same surface (such as the ground,
a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.
Tremorsense can’t detect creatures or objects in
the air, and it doesn’t count as a form of sight.

Truesight
If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced
within a specified range. Within that range, your
vision pierces through the following:

Darkness. You can see in normal and magical
Darkness.
Invisibility. You see creatures and objects that have
the Invisible condition.
Visual Illusions. Visual illusions appear transpar-
ent to you, and you automatically succeed on sav-
ing throws against them.
Transformations. You discern the true form of any
creature or object you see that has been trans-
formed by magic.
Ethereal Plane. You see into the Ethereal Plane.

Unarmed Strike
Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack,
you can use a punch, kick, headbutt, or similar
forceful blow. In game terms, this is an Unarmed
Strike—a melee attack that involves you using your
body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5
feet of you.
Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose
one of the following options for its effect.
Damage. You make an attack roll against the
target. Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength
modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the
target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus
your Strength modifier.
Grapple. The target must succeed on a Strength
or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or it
has the Grappled condition. The DC for the saving
throw and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your
Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This grap-
ple is possible only if the target is no more than one
size larger than you and if you have a hand free to
grab it. See also “Grappling.”
Shove. The target must succeed on a Strength or
Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or you ei-
ther push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the Prone
condition. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 plus
your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This
shove is possible only if the target is no more than
one size larger than you.

---

Unconscious [Condition]
While you have the Unconscious condition, you ex-
perience the following effects.
Inert. You have the Incapacitated and Prone
conditions, and you drop whatever you’re holding.
When this condition ends, you remain Prone.
Speed 0. Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
Attacks Affected. Attack rolls against you have
Advantage.
Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
Automatic Critical Hits. Any attack roll that hits
you is a Critical Hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of
you.
Unaware. You’re unaware of your surroundings.

Unoccupied Space
A space is unoccupied if no creatures are in it and it
isn’t completely filled by objects.

Utilize [Action]
You normally interact with an object while doing
something else, such as when you draw a sword as
part of the Attack action. When an object requires
an action for its use, you take the Utilize action.

Vulnerability
If you have Vulnerability to a damage type, damage
of that type is doubled against you. Vulnerability is
applied only once to an instance of damage. See also
“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

Weapon
A weapon is an object that is in the Simple or
Martial weapon category. See also “Equipment”
(“Weapons”).

Weapon Attack
A weapon attack is an attack roll made with a
weapon. See also “Weapon.”

Gameplay Toolbox

Travel Pace
A group of characters can travel overland at a Nor-
mal, Fast, or Slow pace, as described in “Playing the
Game.” During any journey stage, the predominant
terrain determines the characters’ maximum travel
pace, as shown in the Maximum Pace column of the
Travel Terrain table. Certain factors can affect a
group’s travel pace.
Good Roads

The presence of a good road increases the group’s
maximum pace by one step (from Slow to Normal or
from Normal to Fast).
Slower Travelers

The group must move at a Slow pace if any group
member’s Speed is reduced to half or less of normal.
Extended Travel

Characters can push themselves to travel for more
than 8 hours per day, at the risk of tiring. At the end
of each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours,
each character must succeed on a Constitution sav-
ing throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 10
plus 1 for each hour past 8 hours.
Special Movement

If a party can travel at a high Speed for an extended
time, as with a spell such as Wind Walk or a magic
item such as a Carpet of Flying, translate the party’s
Speed into travel rates using these rules:

*Appropriate equipment (such as skis) is necessary to keep up a Fast pace in Arctic terrain.
†Characters’ rate of travel while waterborne depends on the vehicle carrying them; see “Vehicles.”

Miles per hour = Speed ÷ 10
Miles per day (Normal pace) = Miles per hour  
× number of hours traveled (typically 8)
Fast pace = Miles per day × 1⅓ (round down)
Slow pace = Miles per day × 2/3 (round down)

If the characters are flying or their special move-
ment allows them to ignore Difficult Terrain, they
can move at a Fast pace regardless of the terrain.
Vehicles

Characters traveling in a vehicle use the vehicle’s
speed in miles per hour (as shown in “Equipment”)
to determine their rate of travel, and they don’t
choose a travel pace.
Creating a Background
A character’s background represents what the char-
acter did prior to becoming an adventurer. Creating
a unique background or customizing an existing
one can reflect the particular theme of your cam-
paign or elements of your world. You can also create
a background to help a player craft the story they
have in mind for their character.
This section describes, step by step, how you can
create backgrounds tailored for your world and the
heroes in it.
1: Choose Abilities

Choose three abilities that seem appropriate for the
background:

Strength or Dexterity. These abilities are ideal for
a background involving physical exertion.
Constitution. This ability is ideal for a background
that involves endurance or long hours of activity.

---

Intelligence or Wisdom. One or both abilities are
ideal for a background that focuses on cerebral or
spiritual matters.
Charisma. This ability is ideal for a background
that involves performance or social interaction.
2: Choose a Feat

Choose one feat from the Origin category. See “Ori-
gin Feats” for examples of Origin feats.
3: Choose Skill Proficiencies

Choose two skills appropriate for the background.
There needn’t be a relationship between the skill
proficiencies a background grants and the ability
scores it increases.
4: Choose a Tool Proficiency

Choose one tool used in the practice of the back-
ground or often associated with it.
5: Choose Equipment

Assemble a package of equipment worth 50 GP (in-
cluding unspent gold). Don’t include Martial weap-
ons or armor, as characters get them from their
class choices.
Curses and
Magical Contagions
A curse is a magical burden that lasts for a specified
time or until it is ended by some means. A magical
contagion is an adverse effect of magical origin that
is contagious by definition.
The following sections discuss curses and magical
contagions in detail.
Curses

A curse typically takes one of the forms detailed
below.

Bestow Curse
The simplest curses are created by the Bestow Curse
spell. The effects of such curses are limited and can
be ended by the Remove Curse spell.
Bestow Curse provides useful benchmarks for
gauging the potency of other curses. A curse that
lasts for 1 minute equates to a level 3 spell, while
one that lasts until dispelled equates to a level 9
spell.

Cursed Creatures
Some monsters are associated with curses, whether
as part of their origins or due to their ability to
spread curses—werewolves being a prime example.

	 You decide how a spell like Remove Curse affects 
a creature with accursed origins. For example, you
might decide that a mummy was created through a
curse and it can be destroyed permanently only by
casting Remove Curse on its corpse.

Cursed Magic Items
Cursed magic items are created deliberately or
originate as the result of supernatural events. Such
items are detailed in “Magic Items.”

Narrative Curses
A curse might manifest during an adventure when
a creature’s violation of a taboo warrants supernat-
ural punishment, such as breaking a vow, defiling a
tomb, or murdering an innocent. Such a curse can
have any effects you design, or it might be a custom-
ized version of another type of curse discussed in
this section.
A creature affected by such a curse should know
why they’re being punished and be able to learn
how to end their curse, likely by symbolically
righting the wrong they committed. How a spell
like Remove Curse affects a curse that’s part of your
adventure is up to you—the spell might merely sup-
press the effects of the curse for a time. Regardless,
narrative curses should feel like rare, potent magic
rooted in the lore of your campaign.

Environmental Curses
Some locations are so suffused with evil that any-
one who lingers there is burdened with a curse.
Demonic Possession is one example of an environ-
mental curse.
Demonic Possession. Demonic Possession arises
from the chaos and evil of the Abyss and commonly
besets creatures that interact with demonic objects
or linger in desecrated locations, where demonic
spirits await victims.
A creature that becomes the target of Demonic
Possession must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma sav-
ing throw or be possessed by a bodiless demonic
entity. Whenever the possessed creature rolls a 1
on a D20 Test, the demonic entity takes control of
the creature and determines the creature’s behav-
ior thereafter. At the end of each of the possessed
creature’s later turns, the creature makes a DC 15
Charisma saving throw, regaining control of itself
on a success.
After finishing a Long Rest, a creature with De-
monic Possession makes a DC 15 Charisma saving
throw. On a successful save, the effect ends on the
creature. A Dispel Evil and Good spell or any magic
that removes a curse also ends the effect on it.

---

Magical Contagions

Alchemists, potion brewers, and areas of wild magic
are credited with creating the first magical con-
tagions. An outbreak of such a contagion can form
the basis of an adventure as characters search for a
cure and try to stop the contagion’s spread.

Rest and Recuperation
If a creature infected with a magical contagion
spends 3 days recuperating—engaging in no
activities that would interrupt a Long Rest—the
creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw
at the end of the recuperation period. On a suc-
cessful save, the creature has Advantage on saving
throws to fight off the magical contagion for the
next 24 hours.

Example Contagions
The following examples show how magical conta-
gions can work. Feel free to alter the saving throw
DCs, effects, and other characteristics of these con-
tagions to suit your campaign.

Cackle Fever
Magical Contagion

Cheaply made potions and elixirs are sometimes
tainted by Cackle Fever, which affects Humanoids
only (gnomes are strangely immune). A crea-
ture suffers the following effects 1d4 days after
infection:

Fever. The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level, which
lasts until the contagion ends on the creature.
Uncontrollable Laughter. While the creature has
the Exhaustion condition, the creature makes
a DC 13 Constitution saving throw each time it
takes damage other than Psychic damage. On a
failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) Psychic
damage and has the Incapacitated condition as
it laughs uncontrollably. At the end of each of its
turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the
effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it suc-
ceeds automatically.

	 Fighting the Contagion. At the end of each Long 
Rest, an infected creature makes a DC 13 Constitu-
tion saving throw. After the creature succeeds on
three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and
the creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1 year.
Spreading the Contagion. Any Humanoid (other
than a gnome) that starts its turn within a 10-foot
Emanation originating from a creature infected
with Cackle Fever must succeed on a DC 10 Consti-
tution saving throw or also become infected with
the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid
can’t catch the contagion from that particular in-
fected creature for the next 24 hours.

Sewer Plague
Magical Contagion

Fouled potions and alchemical waste can give rise
to Sewer Plague, which incubates in sewers and
refuse heaps and is sometimes transmitted by
creatures that dwell in such areas, including otyu-
ghs and rats. Any Humanoid that is wounded by a
creature that carries the contagion or that comes
into contact with contaminated filth or offal must
succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be-
come infected with Sewer Plague. A creature suffers
the following effects 1d4 days after infection:

Fatigue. The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level.
Weakness. While the creature has any Exhaustion
levels, it regains only half the normal number of
Hit Points from spending Hit Point Dice.
Restlessness. While the creature has any Exhaus-
tion levels, finishing a Long Rest neither restores
lost Hit Points nor reduces the creature’s Exhaus-
tion level.

	 Fighting the Contagion. Daily at dawn, an in-
fected creature makes a DC 11 Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 Ex-
haustion level as its fatigue worsens. On a success-
ful save, the creature’s Exhaustion level decreases
by 1. If the creature’s Exhaustion level is reduced to
0, the contagion ends on the creature.

Sight Rot
Magical Contagion

Any Beast or Humanoid that drinks water tainted
by Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or have the Blinded condition until the
contagion ends.
Fighting the Contagion. Magic such as a Heal or
Lesser Restoration spell ends the contagion immedi-
ately. A character who is proficient with an Herbal-
ism Kit can use it to create one dose of nonmagical
ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the
eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the oint-
ment suppresses the contagion on that creature for
24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way
for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and
applications of the ointment), the contagion ends on
the creature.
Spreading the Contagion. Any Humanoid that
makes skin contact with a creature infected with
Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or also become infected with the con-
tagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can’t
catch the contagion from that particular infected
creature for the next 24 hours.

---

Environmental Effects
Deep Water

Swimming through deep water (more than 100 feet
deep) presents additional challenges because of the
water’s pressure and cold temperature. After each
hour of swimming in deep water, a creature that
lacks a Swim Speed must succeed on a DC 10 Consti-
tution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level.
Extreme Cold

When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or
lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must
succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at
the end of each hour or gain 1 Exhaustion level.
Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Cold
damage automatically succeed on the save.
Extreme Heat

When the temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or
higher, a creature exposed to the extreme heat and
without access to drinkable water must succeed on
a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour
or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 5 for the first
hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour.
Creatures wearing Medium or Heavy armor have
Disadvantage on the save. Creatures that have Re-
sistance or Immunity to Fire damage automatically
succeed on the save.
Frigid Water

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a
number of minutes equal to its Constitution score
before suffering any ill effects. Each additional
minute spent in frigid water requires the creature
to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or
gain 1 Exhaustion level. Creatures with Resistance
or Immunity to Cold damage automatically suc-
ceed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally
adapted to living in ice-cold water.

Heavy Precipitation

Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy
snowfall is Lightly Obscured, and creatures in the
area have Disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception)
checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames.
High Altitude

Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above
sea level is taxing for most creatures because of the
reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such
a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts
as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long
that creature can travel (see “Travel Pace”).
Creatures can become acclimated to a high alti-
tude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation.
Creatures can’t become acclimated to elevations
above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such
environments.
Slippery Ice

Slippery ice is Difficult Terrain. A creature that
moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn
or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.
Strong Wind

Strong wind imposes Disadvantage on ranged at-
tack rolls with weapons. It also extinguishes open
flames and disperses fog. A flying creature in a
strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.
A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm
that imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks.
Thin Ice

Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 × 10 pounds
per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight
on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice
in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall
through. Below the ice is frigid water (see “Frigid
Water” above).

Fear and Mental Stress
Due to the nature of their vocation, adventurers
tend to be less susceptible to fear and mental stress
than common folk. Whereas a farmer might flee in
terror from a bear or an apparition, adventurers are
made of sterner stuff. That said, certain creatures
and game effects can terrify or fray the mind of
even the most stalwart adventurer.
If you plan to use any of these rules, discuss them
with your players at the start of the campaign.
Fear Effects

Whenever the characters encounter something that
is supernaturally frightful, use the Frightened con-
dition as the baseline effect. Fear effects typically
require a Wisdom saving throw, with a save DC
based on how terrifying the situation is. The Sample
Fear DCs table provides some examples.

Sample Fear DCs

Example
Save DC

When the characters open a sarcophagus, a
harmless yet terrifying apparition appears.
10

A character triggers a magical trap that
creates an illusory manifestation of that
character’s worst fears, visible only to that
character.

A portal to the Abyss opens, revealing a
nightmarish realm of torment and slaughter.
20

Typically, a Frightened creature repeats the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the ef-
fect on itself on a success.
At your discretion, a Frightened creature might
be subject to other effects as long as the Frightened
condition lasts. Consider these examples:

•	 The Frightened creature must take the Dash ac-
tion on each of its turns and uses its movement to
get farther away from the source of its fear.
•	 Attack rolls against the Frightened creature have
Advantage.
•	 	 The Frightened creature can do only one of the
following on each of its turns: move, take an ac-
tion, or take a Bonus Action.

Mental Stress Effects

When a character is subjected to an effect that
causes intense mental stress, Psychic damage is the
best way to emulate that effect.
The Sample Mental Stress Effects table provides a
few examples of such effects, with suggested saving
throw DCs and damage. Mental stress can usually
be resisted with a successful Wisdom save, but
sometimes an Intelligence or Charisma save is more
appropriate. On a successful save, a character might
take half as much damage instead of no damage, at
your discretion.

Sample Mental Stress Effects

Example
Save
DC
Psychic
Damage

10
1d6

A character ingests a hallucinogenic
substance that distorts the charac-
ter’s perception of reality.

A character touches a fiendish idol
that tears at the character’s mind,
threatening to shatter it.

15
3d6

A magical trap flings a character into
the Far Realm until the end of that
character’s next turn.

20
9d6

Prolonged Effects
Exposure to mental stress can cause prolonged ef-
fects. Consider the following possibilities.
Short-Term Effects. The character has the Fright-
ened, Incapacitated, or Stunned condition for 1d10
minutes. This condition might be accompanied by
alarming behavior or hallucinations. These effects
can be suppressed with the Calm Emotions spell or
removed by the Lesser Restoration spell.
Long-Term Effects. The character has Disad-
vantage on some or all ability checks for 1d10 × 10
hours, stemming from an unwillingness or inability
to exert a particular set of abilities. The character
might feel enervated and unable to exert much
Strength, for example, or become so suspicious of
others that Charisma checks are more difficult.
These effects can be suppressed with the Calm
Emotions spell or removed by the Lesser Restoration
spell.
Indefinite Effects. An indefinite effect is a long-
term effect (see above) that lasts until removed by a
Greater Restoration spell. It can be suppressed by a
Calm Emotions spell.

Poison
Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are
a favorite tool among assassins and evil creatures.
Poisons come in the following four types:

Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an
object and remains potent until it is touched or
washed off. A creature that touches contact poi-
son with exposed skin suffers its effects.
Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose
of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose
can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may de-
cide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such
as allowing Advantage on the saving throw or
dealing only half as much damage on a failed save.
Inhaled. Poisonous powders and gases take effect
when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing
the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its
effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately
afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective
against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal mem-
branes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.
Injury. Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus
Action to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or
similar object. The poison remains potent until
delivered through a wound or washed off. A crea-
ture that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from
an object coated with the poison is exposed to its
effects.
Purchasing Poison

In some settings, laws prohibit the possession and
use of poison, but an illicit dealer or unscrupulous
apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters
with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poi-
son easily. Other characters might have to make ex-
tensive inquiries and pay bribes before they acquire
the poison they seek.
Harvesting Poison

A character can attempt to harvest poison from a
venomous creature that is dead or has the Incapaci-
tated condition. The effort takes 1d6 minutes, after
which the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence
(Nature) check using a Poisoner’s Kit. On a success-
ful check, the character harvests enough poison
for a single dose, and no additional poison can be
harvested from that creature. On a failed check,
the character is unable to extract any poison. If the
character fails the check by 5 or more, the character
is subjected to the creature’s poison.

Sample Poisons

Example poisons are detailed here in alphabetical
order. Each poison’s description includes the sug-
gested price for a single dose of the poison, its type
(contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury), and a descrip-
tion of the poison’s debilitating effects.

Assassin’s Blood (150 GP)
Ingested Poison

A creature subjected to Assassin’s Blood makes a
DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature takes 6 (1d12) Poison damage and has
the Poisoned condition for 24 hours. On a successful
save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

Burnt Othur Fumes (500 GP)
Inhaled Poison

A creature subjected to Burnt Othur Fumes must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or
take 10 (3d6) Poison damage, and it must repeat the
save at the start of each of its turns. On each succes-
sive failed save, the creature takes 3 (1d6) Poison
damage. After three successful saves, the poison
ends.

Crawler Mucus (200 GP)
Contact Poison

A creature subjected to Crawler Mucus must suc-
ceed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have
the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. The creature
also has the Paralyzed condition while Poisoned in
this way. The creature repeats the save at the end
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success.

Essence of Ether (300 GP)
Inhaled Poison

A creature subjected to Essence of Ether must suc-
ceed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have
the Poisoned condition for 8 hours. The creature
also has the Unconscious condition while Poisoned
in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes dam-
age or if another creature takes an action to shake
it awake.

Malice (250 GP)
Inhaled Poison

A creature subjected to Malice must succeed on a
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Poi-
soned condition for 1 hour. The creature also has
the Blinded condition while Poisoned in this way.

Midnight Tears (1,500 GP)
Ingested Poison

A creature that ingests Midnight Tears suffers no
effect until the stroke of midnight. Any effect that

---

ends the Poisoned condition neutralizes this poi-
son. If the poison hasn’t been neutralized before
midnight, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) Poison damage on a
failed save or half as much damage on a successful
one.

Oil of Taggit (400 GP)
Contact Poison

A creature subjected to Oil of Taggit must succeed
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the
Poisoned condition for 24 hours. The creature also
has the Unconscious condition while Poisoned in
this way. It wakes up if it takes damage.

Pale Tincture (250 GP)
Ingested Poison

A creature subjected to Pale Tincture must succeed
on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3
(1d6) Poison damage and have the Poisoned condi-
tion. The Poisoned creature repeats the save every
24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage on a failed
save. The damage the poison deals can’t be healed
by any means while the creature remains Poisoned.
After seven successful saves against the poison, the
creature is no longer Poisoned.

Purple Worm Poison (2,000 GP)
Injury Poison

A creature subjected to Purple Worm Poison makes
a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, taking 35 (10d6)
Poison damage on a failed save or half as much dam-
age on a successful one.

Serpent Venom (200 GP)
Injury Poison

A creature subjected to Serpent Venom must suc-
ceed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking

10 (3d6) Poison damage on a failed save or half as
much damage on a successful one.

Spider’s Sting (200 GP)
Injury Poison

A creature subjected to Spider’s Sting must succeed
on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the
Poisoned condition for 1 hour. If the creature fails
the save by 5 or more, the creature also has the Un-
conscious condition while Poisoned in this way. The
creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another
creature takes an action to shake it awake.

Torpor (600 GP)
Ingested Poison

A creature subjected to Torpor poison must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the
Poisoned condition for 4d6 hours. The creature’s
Speed is halved while the creature is Poisoned in
this way.

<!-- Page 199 has tables: 3r x 4c (5–10, 22 (4d10), 15) -->
Traps
Traps should be used sparingly, lest they lose their
charm. A hidden pit can be a fun surprise, but too
many traps in an adventure can lead players to be-
come overly cautious, which slows down the game.
The best traps are fleeting distractions that
skilled characters can overcome in a short amount
of time or deadly puzzles that require quick think-
ing and teamwork to overcome. Traps that are un-
detectable and inescapable are rarely fun.
Parts of a Trap

The description of a trap includes the following
parts after the trap’s name:

Severity and Levels. A trap is designated as a nui-
sance or as deadly for characters of certain levels.  
A nuisance trap is unlikely to seriously harm char-
acters of the indicated levels, whereas a deadly
trap can grievously damage characters of the indi-
cated levels.
Trigger. Traps are often set to go off when a crea-
ture enters an area or touches an object. Examples
of triggers include stepping on a pressure plate,
crossing a trip wire, turning a doorknob, or using
the wrong key in a lock.
Duration. Some traps have durations expressed
in rounds, minutes, or hours. Others specify that
their effects last until the trap is destroyed or
dispelled. If a trap’s duration is instantaneous, its
effect is resolved instantly. If a trap resets after
activating, that fact is noted in this entry. A trap is
otherwise inert after activation.

Use caution when introducing a trap to characters
of a level lower than the trap’s level range. A trap
that is a nuisance at one level range could be deadly
to characters of a lower level range.
Example Traps

Traps are presented in alphabetical order.

Collapsing Roof
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)

Trigger: A creature crosses a trip wire
Duration: Instantaneous

This trap uses a trip wire to collapse an unstable
section of ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the
ground and stretches between two weak supports
that topple when the trip wire is pulled.
The first creature that crosses the trip wire
causes the supports to topple and the unstable sec-
tion of ceiling to collapse. Each creature beneath the
unstable section of ceiling must succeed on a DC 13
Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) Bludgeon-
ing damage on a failed save or half as much damage

on a successful one. Rubble from the collapse turns
the trapped area into Difficult Terrain.  
Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature
can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire
and the unstable section of ceiling on a successful
check. Once detected, the trip wire can be easily cut
or avoided (no ability check required).
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as
shown in the following table.

Levels
Bludgeoning Damage
Save DC

5–10
22 (4d10)
15

11–16
55 (10d10)
17

17–20
99 (18d10)
19

Falling Net
Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)

Trigger: A creature crosses a trip wire
Duration: Instantaneous

A falling net trap uses a trip wire to release a
weighted, 10-foot-square Net suspended from the
ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and
stretches between two columns or trees.
The first creature that crosses the trip wire
causes the Net to fall on it. The target must suc-
ceed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the
Restrained condition until it escapes. The target
succeeds automatically if it’s Huge or larger. A crea-
ture can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength
(Athletics) check, freeing itself or another creature
within its reach from the Net on a successful check.  
Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature
can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire
and the suspended Net on a successful check. Once
detected, the trip wire can be easily cut or avoided
(no ability check required).
Destroy the Net. Reducing the Net to 0 Hit Points
frees any creature trapped in it (see “Adventuring
Gear” for the Net’s statistics).
Set the Trap. A creature that has Thieves’ Tools
and all the trap’s components (including a Net) can
try to set a falling net trap, doing so with a success-
ful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Each
attempt to set this trap takes 10 minutes.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the weight of the Net, which
increases the save DC and the DC of the Strength
(Athletics) check as follows: DC 12 at levels 5–10, DC
14 at levels 11–16, or DC 16 at levels 17–20.

Fire-Casting Statue
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)

Trigger: A creature moves onto a pressure plate

---


<!-- Page 200 has tables: 3r x 3c (5–10, 30 feet, 10 (3d6)); 3r x 3c (5–10, 22 (4d10), 30-foot Cone) -->
Duration: Instantaneous, and the trap resets at the
start of the next turn

When a creature moves onto this trap’s pressure
plate for the first time on a turn or starts its turn
there, a nearby statue exhales a 15-foot Cone of
magical flame. The statue can look like anything,
such as a dragon or a wizard. Each creature in the
Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 11 (2d10) Fire damage on a failed
save or half as much damage on a successful one.
Detect and Disarm. A Detect Magic spell reveals
an aura of Evocation magic around the statue. As a
Search action, a creature within 5 feet of the statue
can examine it and make a DC 10 Wisdom (Percep-
tion) check, detecting a tiny glyph on the statue on a
successful check. Once the glyph is found, a charac-
ter can take a Study action to examine it and make a
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, ascertaining that
the glyph means “fire” on a successful check. As an
action, a character can use a sharp tool to deface the
glyph, which disarms the trap.
As a Search action, a creature can examine the
section of floor that forms the pressure plate and
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting
the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging
an Iron Spike or similar object under the pressure
plate prevents the trap from triggering.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the damage and the area of ef-
fect, as shown in the following table.

Levels
Fire Damage
Area of Effect

5–10
22 (4d10)
30-foot Cone

11–16
55 (10d10)
60-foot Cone

17–20
99 (18d10)
120-foot Cone

Hidden Pit
Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)

Trigger: A creature moves onto the pit’s lid
Duration: Instantaneous

This 10-foot-deep pit has a hinged lid constructed
from material identical to the surrounding floor.
When a creature moves onto the lid, it swings open
like a trapdoor, causing the creature to fall into the
pit. The lid remains open thereafter.
A creature that falls into the pit takes 3 (1d6)
Bludgeoning damage from the fall.
Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature
can examine the section of floor that forms the
pit’s lid and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check, detecting the pit on a successful check.
Once the pit is detected, an Iron Spike or a similar
object can be wedged between the pit’s lid and the
surrounding floor to prevent the lid from opening,
thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also
be held shut using Arcane Lock or similar magic.

	 Escape. A creature needs a Climb Speed, climbing 
gear, or magic such as Spider Climb to scale the pit’s
smooth walls. You can make the pit easier to escape
by adding cracks in the walls big enough to serve as
handholds and footholds.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the pit’s depth and damage, as
shown in the following table.

Levels
Pit Depth
Bludgeoning Damage

5–10
30 feet
10 (3d6)

11–16
60 feet
21 (6d6)

17–20
120 feet
42 (12d6)

Poisoned Darts
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)

Trigger: A creature moves onto a pressure plate
Duration: Instantaneous, and the trap resets at the
start of the next turn if it has activated fewer than
three times

When a creature moves onto this trap’s pressure
plate for the first time on a turn, poisoned darts
shoot from tubes embedded in the surrounding
walls. The holes that house these tubes are ob-
scured by dust and cobwebs or skillfully hidden
amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes.
Each creature in the darts’ path must succeed on
a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by 1d3
darts, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage per dart.
Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature
can examine the walls and make a DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check, detecting the holes on a suc-
cessful check. Plugging all the holes with wax, cloth,
or detritus prevents the darts from firing.
As a Search action, a creature can examine the
section of floor that forms the pressure plate and
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting
the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging
an Iron Spike or a similar object under the pressure
plate prevents the trap from triggering.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing each dart’s Poison damage as
follows: 7 (2d6) at levels 5–10, 14 (4d6) at levels
11–16, or 24 (7d6) at levels 17–20.

Poisoned Needle
Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)

Trigger: A creature opens the trap’s lock improperly
or fails to disarm the trap
Duration: Instantaneous

A poisoned needle is hidden in a lock. When a crea-
ture opens the lock with any object other than the
proper key, the needle springs out and stabs the
creature. The creature makes a DC 11 Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
5 (1d10) Poison damage and has the Poisoned

<!-- Page 201 has tables: 3r x 4c (5–10, 11 (2d10), 13); 3r x 3c (5–10, 30 feet, 10 (3d6) Bludge) -->
condition for 1 hour. On a successful save, the crea-
ture takes half as much damage only.  
Avoid. The trap doesn’t trigger if the lock is
opened using a Knock spell or similar magic.
Detect and Disarm. As a Search action, a creature
can examine the trapped lock and make a DC 15
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the needle on
a successful check. Once the trap is detected, a char-
acter can take an action to try to disarm the trap,
doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight
of Hand) check. On a failed check, the creature trig-
gers the trap.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as
shown in the following table.

Levels
Poison Damage
Save DC

5–10
11 (2d10)
13

11–16

Rolling Stone
Deadly Trap (Levels 11–16) or Nuisance Trap (Levels
17–20)

Trigger: A creature moves onto a pressure plate
Duration: Until the stone stops rolling

When a creature moves onto a hidden pressure
plate, a 5-foot-radius orb of solid stone is released
from a secret compartment and begins to roll. The
stone and all creatures nearby roll Initiative; the
stone gets a +8 bonus on its Initiative roll.
On its turn, the stone moves 60 feet in one direc-
tion, changing course if redirected by an obstacle.
The stone can move through creatures’ spaces,
and creatures can move through the stone’s space,
treating it as Difficult Terrain. Whenever the stone
enters a creature’s space for the first time on a turn
or a creature enters the stone’s space while the
stone is rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC
15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) Blud-
geoning damage and have the Prone condition.
The stone stops when it hits a wall or similar
barrier. It can’t go around corners, but creative
dungeon builders incorporate curving turns into
nearby passages that allow the stone to keep
moving.
Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature
can examine the section of floor that forms the
pressure plate and make a DC 15 Intelligence (In-
vestigation) check, deducing the pressure plate’s
function on a successful check. Wedging an Iron
Spike or a similar object under the pressure plate
prevents the trap from triggering.

	 Destroy the Stone. The stone is a Large object 
that has AC 17, HP 100, a Damage Threshold of 10,
and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.
Slow the Stone. As an action, a creature can try to
slow down the stone with a DC 20 Strength (Athlet-
ics) check. If the check is successful, the distance the
stone moves on its turn is reduced by 15 feet. If that
distance drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer
a threat.

Spiked Pit
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)

Trigger: A creature moves onto the pit’s lid
Duration: Instantaneous

A 10-foot-deep pit has a hinged lid constructed from
material identical to the surrounding floor. When
a creature moves onto the lid, it swings open like
a trapdoor, causing the creature to fall into the pit,
which has sharpened wooden or metal spikes at the
bottom. The lid remains open thereafter.
A creature that falls into the pit lands at the
bottom and takes 3 (1d6) Bludgeoning damage
from the fall plus 9 (2d8) Piercing damage from
the spikes.
Detect and Disarm. As a Study action, a creature
can examine the section of floor that forms the pit’s
lid and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)
check, detecting the pit on a successful check. Once
the hidden pit is detected, an Iron Spike or a similar
object can be wedged between the pit’s lid and the
surrounding floor to prevent the lid from opening,
thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also
be held shut using an Arcane Lock spell or similar
magic.
Escape. A creature needs a Climb Speed, climbing
gear, or magic such as a Spider Climb spell to scale
the pit’s smooth walls. You can make the pit easier
to escape by adding cracks in the walls big enough
to serve as handholds and footholds.
At Higher Levels. You can scale the trap for higher
levels by increasing the pit’s depth and damage, as
shown in the following table.

Levels
Pit Depth
Damage

5–10
30 feet
10 (3d6) Bludgeoning plus 13
(3d8) Piercing

11–16

21 (6d6) Bludgeoning plus 36
(8d8) Piercing

17–20
120 feet
42 (12d6) Bludgeoning plus 57
(13d8) Piercing

Combat Encounters
The following features can make a combat encoun-
ter more interesting or challenging:

Changes in Elevation. Terrain features that pro-
vide a change of elevation (such as stacks of empty
crates, ledges, and balconies) reward clever posi-
tioning and encourage characters to jump, climb,
fly, or teleport.
Defensive Positions. Enemies in hard-to-reach
locations or defensive positions force characters
who normally attack at range to move around.
Mixed Monster Groups. When different types
of monsters work together, they can combine
their abilities—just like characters with differ-
ent classes and origins. A diverse force is more
powerful.
Reasons to Move. Use features that encourage
characters and their enemies to move around,
such as chandeliers, kegs of gunpowder or oil, and
rolling stone traps.
Combat Encounter Difficulty

Use the following guidelines to create a combat en-
counter of a desired level of difficulty.

Step 1: Choose a Difficulty
Three categories describe the range of encounter
difficulty:

Low Difficulty. An encounter of low difficulty is
likely to have one or two scary moments for the
players, but their characters should emerge vic-
torious with no casualties. One or more of them
might need to use healing resources, however.
As a rough guideline, a single monster generally
presents a low-difficulty challenge for a party of
four characters whose level equals the monster’s
Challenge Rating.
Moderate Difficulty. Absent healing and other re-
sources, an encounter of moderate difficulty could
go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters
might get taken out of the fight, and there’s a slim
chance that one or more characters might die.
High Difficulty. A high-difficulty encounter could
be lethal for one or more characters. To survive
it, the characters will need smart tactics, quick
thinking, and maybe even a little luck.

Step 2: Determine Your XP Budget
Using the XP Budget per Character table, cross-ref-
erence the party’s level with the desired encounter
difficulty. Multiply the number in the table by the
number of characters in the party to get your XP
budget for the encounter.

Step 3: Spend Your Budget
Every creature has an XP value in its stat block.
When you add a creature to your combat encounter,
deduct its XP from your XP budget to determine
how many XP you have left to spend. Spend as much
of your XP budget as you can without going over. It’s
OK if you have a few unspent XP left over. Examples
are given below:

Example 1. A low-difficulty encounter for four level
1 characters has an XP budget of 50 × 4, for a total
of 200 XP. With that, you could build any of the fol-
lowing encounters:

•		1 Bugbear Warrior (200 XP)
•		2 Giant Wasps (100 XP each), for 200 XP total
•		6 Giant Rats (25 XP each), for 150 XP total

Example 2. A moderate-difficulty encounter for
five level 3 characters has an XP budget of 225 × 5,
for a total of 1,125 XP. With that, you could build
either of these encounters:

•		2 Druids (450 XP each) and 9 Stirges (25 XP
each), for 1,125 XP total
•		1 Wight (700 XP), 1 Warhorse Skeleton (100 XP),
and 6 Skeletons (50 XP each), for 1,100 XP total

---

Example 3. A high-difficulty encounter for six level
15 characters has an XP budget of 7,800 × 6, for a
total of 46,800 XP. With that, you could build this
encounter:

•		2 Adult Red Dragons (18,000 XP each) and 2 Fire
Giants (5,000 XP each), for 46,000 XP total
Troubleshooting

When creating and running combat encounters,
keep the following in mind.

Many Creatures
The more creatures in an encounter, the higher
the risk that a lucky streak on their part could deal
more damage to the characters than you expect. If
your encounter includes more than two creatures
per character, include fragile creatures that can be
defeated quickly. This guideline is especially im-
portant for characters of level 1 or 2.

Adjustments
A player’s absence might warrant removing crea-
tures from an encounter to keep it at the intended
difficulty. Also, die rolls and other factors can result
in an encounter being easier or harder than in-
tended. You can adjust an encounter on the fly, such
as by having creatures flee (making the encounter
easier) or adding reinforcements (making the en-
counter harder).

CR 0 Creatures
Creatures that have a CR of 0, particularly ones that
are worth 0 XP, should be used sparingly. If you
want to include many CR 0 critters in an encounter,
use swarms instead.

Number of Stat Blocks
The best combat encounters often pair one kind of
creature with another, such as fire giants paired
with hell hounds. Be mindful of the number of stat
blocks you need to run the encounter. Referencing
more than two or three stat blocks for a single en-
counter can be daunting, particularly if the crea-
tures are complex.

Powerful Creatures
If your combat encounter includes a creature whose
CR is higher than the party’s level, be aware that
such a creature might deal enough damage with a
single action to take out one or more characters. For
example, an Ogre (CR 2) can kill a level 1 Wizard
with a single blow.

Unusual Features
If a monster has a feature that lower-level charac-
ters can’t easily overcome, consider not adding that
monster to an encounter for characters whose level
is lower than the monster’s Challenge Rating.

Magic Items

Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of felled
monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such
items grant capabilities a character could rarely
have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s
capabilities in wondrous ways.
Magic Item Categories
Every magic item belongs to a category. The Magic
Item Categories table lists the nine categories and
provides examples. Rules for the categories appear
after the table.

Magic Item Categories

Category
Examples

Armor
+1 Leather Armor, +1 Shield

Potions
Potion of Healing

Rings
Ring of Invisibility

Rods
Immovable Rod

Scrolls
Spell Scroll

Staffs
Staff of Striking

Wands
Wand of Fireballs

Weapons
+1 Ammunition, +1 Longsword

Wondrous Items
Bag of Holding, Boots of Elvenkind

Armor

An item in the Armor category is typically a magical
version of armor from “Equipment.” Unless an ar-
mor’s description notes otherwise, the armor must
be worn for its magic to function.
Some suits of magic armor specify the type of ar-
mor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If
no type is specified, choose the type or determine it
randomly.
Potions

An item in the Potion category might be a magical
brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be
applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion
consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial.
Using a Potion. Potions are consumable items.
Drinking a potion or administering it to another
creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil
might take longer as specified in its description.
Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it
is used up.
Mixing Potions. A character might drink one po-
tion while still under the effects of another or pour
several potions into a single container. The strange
ingredients used in creating potions can result in
unpredictable interactions.

	 When a character mixes two potions together, roll 
on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are
combined, roll again for each subsequent potion,
combining the results. Unless the effects are imme-
diately obvious, reveal them only when they become
evident.

Potion Miscibility

1d100
Result

01
Both potions lose their effects, and the
mixture creates a magical explosion in a
5-foot-radius Sphere centered on itself.
Each creature in that area takes 4d10 Force
damage.

02–08
Both potions lose their effects, and the mix-
ture becomes an ingested poison of your
choice (see “Poison” in “Gameplay Toolbox”).

09–15
Both potions lose their effects.

16–25
One potion loses its effect.

26–35
Both potions work, but with their numerical
effects and durations halved. If a potion has
no numerical effect and no duration, it instead
loses its effect.

36–90
Both potions work normally.

91–99
Both potions work, but the numerical effects
and duration of one potion are doubled. If nei-
ther potion has anything to double in this way,
they work normally.

00
Only one potion works, but its effects are
permanent. Choose the simplest effect to
make permanent or the one that seems the
most fun. For example, a Potion of Healing
might increase the drinker’s Hit Point maxi-
mum by 2d4 + 2, or a Potion of Invisibility might
give the drinker the Invisible condition indefi-
nitely. At your discretion, a Dispel Magic spell
or similar magic might end this lasting effect.

Rings

For its magic to function, an item in the Ring cate-
gory must be worn on a finger or a similar digit un-
less its description notes otherwise.
Rods

An item in the Rod category is a scepter usually
made of metal, wood, or bone. A typical rod weighs
2 to 5 pounds.
Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can
be used as an Arcane Focus.

---

Scrolls

An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or
parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods
and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade,
leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is
the Spell Scroll, a spell stored in written form.
Using a Scroll. Scrolls are consumable items. Un-
leashing the magic in a scroll requires the user to
read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked,
the scroll can’t be used again. Its words fade, or it
crumbles into dust.
Any creature that can understand a written lan-
guage can read a scroll and attempt to activate it
unless its description notes otherwise.
Staffs

Items in the Staff category vary widely in appear-
ance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout
and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some
are made of wood, and others are composed of pol-
ished metal or crystal. A staff weighs between 2 and
7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane.
Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can
be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane
Focus.
Wands

An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15
inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It
is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other
material.
Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand
can be used as an Arcane Focus.
Weapons

A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a
weapon from “Equipment.” Some magic weapons
specify the type of weapon they are in their de-
scriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no
weapon type is specified, you may choose the type
or determine it randomly.
Ammunition. If a magic weapon has the Ammu-
nition property, ammunition fired from it is consid-
ered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares
whether a weapon is magical or not.
Wondrous Items

Wondrous Items include wearable items such
as boots, belts, capes, amulets, brooches, and
circlets. Bags, carpets, figurines, horns, musical
instruments, and more also fall into this category.

Magic Item Rules

Rules for identifying, attuning to, and using magic
items appear in “Equipment.” Additional rules are
presented below.
Attunement Prerequisites. If a magic item has
a class prerequisite, a creature must be a member of
that class to attune to the item. If a creature must be
a spellcaster to attune to an item, the creature qual-
ifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or
features, not by using a magic item or the like.
Items Made for Specific Creatures. Magic
items that are meant to be worn tend to magically
adjust themselves to the wearer. However, you can
decide that a magic item doesn’t adjust its size to fit
any wearer. For example, a particular armorer might
make items usable only by folk who are sized and
shaped like dwarves.
Unusual Anatomy. Use your discretion to decide
whether a creature can wear an item not made for
its anatomy. A ring placed on a tentacle might work,
but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can’t
wear magic boots.
Paired Items. You can allow exceptions to the
rule that paired items must both be worn. For ex-
ample, a character with only one arm might be able
to use a single Glove of Missile Snaring so long as the
matching glove is on their person.

Magic Item Rarity
Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a
rough measure of an item’s power relative to other
magic items. The rarities are shown in the Magic
Item Rarities and Values table.
Common magic items, such as a Potion of Healing,
are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such as the Dragon
Orb, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire.
Magic Item Values by Rarity

Common magic items can often be bought in a
town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are
usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items
might be sold only in wondrous locations, such as a
city on another plane of existence. If you allow char-
acters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign,
rarity can help you set prices for those items. Gold
Piece values are provided in the Magic Item Rarities
and Values table, though a seller might ask for a ser-
vice rather than coin as payment.
If a magic item incorporates an item that has a
purchase cost in “Equipment” (such as a weapon or
a suit of armor), add that item’s cost to the magic
item’s value. For example, +1 Armor (Plate Armor)

---

has a value of 5,500 GP, which is the sum of a Rare
magic item’s value (4,000 GP) and the cost of Plate
Armor (1,500 GP).

The value of a Spell Scroll is double what it costs to scribe the scroll

Activating a Magic Item
It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic
item. The item’s user might also need to do some-
thing special. The description of each item category
or individual item details how an item is activated.
Certain items use the following rules for their
activation.
Command Word

A command word is a word or short phrase that
must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spo-
ken command words must be audible and fail to
work in areas where all sound is suppressed, as in
the area of the Silence spell.
Consumable Items

Some items are consumed—used up, in other
words—when they are activated. A Potion of Healing
must be swallowed, for example, while the writing
vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a
consumable item loses its magic.

Spells Cast from Items
Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from
the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible
spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the us-
er’s spell slots, and requires no components unless
the item’s description notes otherwise. The spell
uses its normal casting time, range, and duration,
and the user of the item must concentrate if the
spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as
Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the
spell’s effects with its usual duration. Certain items
make exceptions to these rules, changing the cast-
ing time, duration, or other parts of a spell.
A magic item may require the user to use their
own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from
the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting
ability, the user chooses which one to use with the
item. If the user doesn’t have a spellcasting ability,

their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item,
and the user’s Proficiency Bonus applies.

Charges
Some magic items have charges that must be ex-
pended to activate their properties. The number
of charges an item has remaining is revealed when
the Identify spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to
an item knows how many charges the item has and
how many it regains.
“The Next Dawn”
Magic items often have charges or properties that
recharge at the next dawn or some other specified
time. If such an item is on a world or plane of exis-
tence where the specified event doesn’t occur, the
GM determines when the item recharges.
Cursed Items
A magic item’s description specifies whether it
bears a curse. Most methods of identifying items, in-
cluding the Identify spell, fail to reveal such a curse.
Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended volun-
tarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with a
Remove Curse spell.
Magic Item Resilience
A magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical
item of its kind. Most magic items, other than Po-
tions and Scrolls, have Resistance to all damage.
An Artifact can be destroyed only in some special
way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Learn-
ing how to destroy an Artifact usually requires
research or the completion of a quest.
Crafting Magic Items
“Equipment” contains rules on brewing Potions of
Healing and scribing Spell Scrolls. To create other
magic items, follow the rules below. In these rules,
“you” refers to the character crafting the magic
item.
Arcana Proficiency

To craft a magic item, you and any assistants must
have proficiency in the Arcana skill.
Tools

The Magic Item Tools table lists which tool is re-
quired to make a magic item of each category. You
must use the required tool to make an item and
have proficiency with that tool. Any assistants must
also have proficiency with it. For more information
on the tools, see “Equipment.”

Spells

If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells
from it, you must have all those spells prepared ev-
ery day you spend crafting the item.
Time and Cost

Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and
money based on the item’s rarity as shown in the
Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table.
Work per Day. For each day of crafting, you must
work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days,
those days needn’t be consecutive.
Assistants. Characters can combine their efforts
to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed
to create an item by the number of characters work-
ing on it. Normally, only one other character can
assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.
Raw Materials. The cost in the table represents
the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The
GM determines whether appropriate raw materials
are available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance
that the materials are available, and in any other
settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials
aren’t available, you must wait at least 7 days before
checking on the availability again.
If a magic item incorporates an item that has a
purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor),
you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item
using the rules in “Equipment.” For example, to
make +1 Armor (Plate Armor), you must pay 3,500
GP or pay 2,000 GP and craft the armor.

Sentient Magic Items
Some magic items have sentience and personality.
Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the
spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to
the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be
a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in
the side.
Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds
of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items
such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.
The GM controls sentient magic items and their
activated properties. A bearer who maintains a
good relationship with the item can access those
properties. If the relationship is strained, a conflict
can ensue (see “Conflict” below).
Sentient Magic Item Traits

When you make a sentient magic item, you create
the item’s persona much as you would create an
NPC, with these exceptions.

Abilities
A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma scores. Choose the item’s abilities, or de-
termine them randomly as follows: roll 4d6 for each
one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.

Alignment
A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator
or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise,
pick an alignment or roll on the Sentient Item’s
Alignment table.

Communication
A sentient item communicates by sharing its emo-
tions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or
speaking aloud. You can choose how it communi-
cates or roll on the Sentient Item’s Communication
table.

Senses
A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to
a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on
the Sentient Item’s Senses table.

Special Purpose
You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues,
perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the
wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special
purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating
from this course might cause conflict between the
wielder and the item (see “Conflict” below). You can
pick a special purpose or roll on the Sentient Item’s
Special Purpose table.

bearer have key roles to play in future events.

1d10
Special Purpose

5
Destroyer. The item craves destruction and
goads its user to fight arbitrarily.

6
Glory Seeker. The item seeks renown as the
greatest magic item in the world by winning
fame or notoriety for its user.

7
Lore Seeker. The item craves knowledge or is
determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret,
or unravel a cryptic prophecy.

8
Protector. The item seeks to defend a par-
ticular kind of creature, such as elves or
werewolves.

9
Soulmate Seeker. The item seeks another
sentient magic item, perhaps one that is similar
to itself.

10
Templar. The item seeks to defend the ser-
vants and interests of a particular deity.

Conflict
When the bearer of a sentient item acts in a manner
opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict
can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item’s
bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus
the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the
item makes one or more of the following demands:

Chase My Dreams. The item demands that its
bearer pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of
all other goals.
Get Rid of It. The item demands that its bearer dis-
pose of anything the item finds repugnant.
It’s Time for a Change. The item demands to be
given to someone else.
Keep Me Close. The item insists on being carried or
worn at all times.

If its bearer refuses to comply with the item’s de-
mands, the item can do any of the following:

•	 Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to it.
•	 Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
•	 Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon
the bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC
12 plus the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed
save, the bearer has the Charmed condition for
1d12 hours. While Charmed in this way, the
bearer must try to follow the item’s commands.
If the bearer takes damage, it repeats the save,
ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the
attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item
can’t use this power again until the next dawn.

Monsters

Stat Block Overview
A monster has a stat block that contains the rules
necessary to use it in the game. Stat blocks are di-
vided into the following parts:

Name and General Details. The name of the mon-
ster is followed by its size, creature type (along
with any descriptive tags), and alignment.
Combat Highlights. Armor Class, Hit Points, Speed,
and Initiative are provided here.
Ability Scores. A monster’s ability scores, ability
modifiers, and saving throws are listed here.
Other Details. The monster’s Senses, Languages,
and CR entries appear here. Additional details ap-
pear in some monsters, such as skill proficiencies,
Resistances, Immunities, and Gear. If a monster
lacks those details, entries for them don’t appear.
Traits. Monster characteristics that are active at all
times or during certain situations appear here.
Actions. The monster can take the actions here in
addition to those in “Playing the Game.”
Bonus Actions. This section provides a monster’s
Bonus Actions, if any.
Reactions and Legendary Actions. These sections
provide Reactions and Legendary Actions, if any.
Parts of a Stat Block
The rules for a stat block are detailed in “Rules Glos-
sary” and in this section.
Size

A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge,
or Gargantuan. If size options are presented, you
choose the creature’s size from those options. See
“Playing the Game” for information on size.
Creature Type

Each monster has a tag that identifies the type of
creature it is. Certain spells, magic items, class fea-
tures, and other effects in the game interact in spe-
cial ways with creatures of a particular type.
The game includes the following creature types,
which have no rules of their own:

Aberrations are utterly alien beings, such as abo-
leths and cloakers.
Beasts are non-Humanoid natural creatures, like
horses and wolves, as well as most giant animals.
Celestials are magical creatures, such as angels and
pegasi, with ties to the Upper Planes.
Constructs are magically created creatures such as
homunculi and shield guardians.
Dragons are scaly beings of ancient origin, such as
red dragons and wyverns.

Elementals are beings from the Elemental Planes,
such as efreet and water elementals.
Fey are creatures tied to the Feywild or the forces
of nature, such as dryads and goblins.
Fiends are creatures tied to terrifying Lower
Planes, such as balors and hell hounds.
Giants are towering beings with humanlike shapes,
like fire giants and trolls.
Humanoids are people defined by their roles and
professions, such as mages, pirates, and warriors.
They include members of varied species.
Monstrosities are unnatural creatures with
strange origins, such as mimics and owlbears.
Oozes are gelatinous creatures, including black
puddings and gelatinous cubes.
Plants are sentient vegetation and fungal monsters,
such as shambling mounds and treants.
Undead are spirits and the reanimated dead, such
as ghosts, vampires, and zombies.

Descriptive Tags
A monster might have one or more tags in parenthe-
ses following its type. Such tags provide additional
categorization and have no rules of their own, but
certain game effects might refer to them.
Alignment

The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is
a default suggestion of how to roleplay the monster,
inspired by its traditional role in the game or real-​
world folklore. Change a monster’s alignment to
suit your storytelling needs. The Neutral alignment,
in particular, is an invitation for you to consider
whether an individual leans toward one of the other
alignments.
“Character Creation” describes the nine align-
ments and unaligned creatures.
Armor Class

A monster’s Armor Class (AC) includes its natural
armor, Dexterity, gear, and other defenses. See
“Playing the Game” for information on Armor Class.
Initiative

The Initiative entry specifies the monster’s Initia-
tive modifier followed by the monster’s Initiative
score in parentheses. Use the modifier when you
roll to determine a monster’s Initiative. A monster’s
Initiative modifier is typically equal to its Dexterity
modifier, but some monsters have additional mod-
ifiers, such as Proficiency Bonus, applied to that
number.
If you don’t want to roll a monster’s Initiative, use
the Initiative score as the monster’s Initiative in
combat. Initiative is further detailed in “Playing the
Game.”

---


<!-- Page 255 has tables: 5r x 3c (Tiny, d4, 2½) -->
Hit Points

A monster’s Hit Points are presented as a number
followed by parentheses, where the monster’s Hit
Point Dice are provided, along with any contribu-
tion from its Constitution. Either use the number for
the monster’s Hit Points or roll the die expression in
parentheses to determine the monster’s Hit Points
randomly; don’t use both.
A monster’s size typically determines the die used
to calculate its Hit Points, as shown in the Hit Dice
by Size table.

Hit Dice by Size

Small
d6
3½

Medium
d8
4½

Large
d10
5½

Huge
d12
6½

Gargantuan
d20
10½

A monster’s Constitution modifier is multiplied by
the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result
is added to its Hit Points. For example, if a monster
has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit
Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 Hit Points (average 11).
For more on Hit Points, see “Playing the Game.”
Speed

The Speed entry specifies a monster’s Speed. Some
monsters have one or more of the following speeds:
Burrow, Climb, Fly, Swim. Rules for Speed and these
specials speeds appear in “Rules Glossary.”
Ability Scores

Every monster has six ability scores along with
corresponding ability score modifiers and saving
throw modifiers. For more information on ability
scores and saving throws, see “Playing the Game.”
Skills

The Skills entry specifies a monster’s skill profi-
ciencies, if any. For example, a monster that is very
perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wis-
dom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A
skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability
modifier and its Proficiency Bonus. Other modifiers
might apply.
Resistances and Vulnerabilities

These entries list a monster’s Resistances and Vul-
nerabilities, if any. See “Playing the Game” for more
information.

Running a Monster

To ensure a monster acts in accordance with its
Challenge Rating, follow these rules during combat:

Special Abilities. If the monster has a special abil-
ity that deals a lot of damage but has a limited
number of uses, such as a recharging breath
weapon or a spell it can cast only once per day,
have it use that special ability as quickly and as
often as possible.
Multiattack. If the monster has Multiattack, have
it use Multiattack on any of its turns in which
it’s not using one of its more powerful abilities.
Bonus Actions, Reactions, Legendary Actions. If
the monster has Bonus Actions, Reactions, or
Legendary Actions in its stat block, make sure it
uses them as often as it can.

Immunities

This entry lists the monster’s Immunities, if any. If
the monster has damage and condition Immunities,
the damage types are listed before the conditions.
See “Playing the Game” for details.
Gear

Monsters have proficiency with their equipment. If
a monster has equipment that can be given away or
retrieved, the items are listed in the Gear entry. The
monster’s stat block might include special flour-
ishes that happen when the monster uses an item,
and the stat block might ignore the rules in “Equip-
ment” for that item. When used by someone else, a
retrievable item uses its “Equipment” rules, ignor-
ing any special flourishes in the stat block.
The Gear entry doesn’t necessarily list all of a
monster’s equipment. For example, a monster that
wears clothes is assumed to be dressed appropri-
ately, and those clothes aren’t in this entry.
Equipment mentioned outside the Gear entry is
considered to be supernatural or highly specialized,
and it is unusable when the monster is defeated.

Ammunition and Ranged Attacks
A monster that requires ammunition to make
ranged attacks carries the necessary ammunition.

Equipping a Monster with Other Items
You may equip monsters with additional gear how-
ever you like, using the items in “Equipment” for
inspiration. You decide how much of a monster’s
equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain
and whether any of that equipment is still usable.
Beware of giving a monster combat-oriented
magic items, since those might alter the monster’s
Challenge Rating. If you do give a monster a magic
item, the monster can have Attunement with magic
items as noted in “Equipment.” A monster with

---

a class tag after its creature type is considered a
member of that class for Attunement purposes.
Senses

The Senses entry specifies a monster’s Passive
Perception score, as well as any special senses the
monster possesses. Passive Perception and special
senses are described in “Rules Glossary.”
Languages

This entry lists languages that the monster can use
to communicate. Sometimes a monster can under-
stand a language but can’t communicate with it,
which is noted in its entry. “None” indicates that a
creature doesn’t comprehend any language.

Telepathy
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature
to communicate mentally with another creature
within a specified range. See “Rules Glossary” for
more information.
Challenge Rating

Challenge Rating is defined in “Rules Glossary,”
while guidance on using CR to plan potential com-
bat encounters is in “Gameplay Toolbox.”

Experience Points
The number of Experience Points (XP) a monster
is worth is based on its CR, as detailed in the Ex-
perience Points by Challenge Rating table. XP is
awarded for defeating the monster in combat or
otherwise neutralizing it.
Unless a rule says otherwise, a monster sum-
moned by a spell or another magical ability is worth
the XP noted in its stat block.

throws, skills, and other statistics where the mon-
ster’s exceptional aptitude is a factor.

Traits

A monster’s traits, if any, are features that are ac-
tive at all times or in certain situations.
Actions

A monster can take the actions in this section or
take one of the actions available to all creatures, as
described in “Playing the Game.”

Attack Notation
The entry for a monster’s attack identifies whether
the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then
provides the attack roll’s bonus, its reach or range,
and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one
target unless its entry says otherwise. For details
on different kinds of attacks, see “Playing the Game”
and “Spells.”
Hit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur
as a result of an attack hitting a target are described
after the “Hit:” notation.
Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a
miss, that information follows the “Miss:” notation.
Hit or Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs
regardless of whether it hits or misses its target,
that information follows the “Hit or Miss:” notation.

Saving Throw Effect Notation
If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect identi-
fies the kind of save required and then provides the
save’s DC, a description of which creatures make
the save, and an explanation of what happens on a
failed or successful save.
“Half damage only” on a successful save means
the target takes half as much damage (round down)
as targets that fail the save, while also ignoring all
other parts of the effect.

---

Damage Notation
A stat block usually provides both a number and a
die expression for each instance of damage. For ex-
ample, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a
hit. You decide whether to use the number or the die
expression in parentheses; don’t use both.

Multiattack
Some creatures can make more than one attack
when they take the Attack action. Such creatures
have the Multiattack entry in the “Actions” section
of their stat block. This entry details the attacks a
creature can make, as well as any additional abili-
ties it can use, as part of the Attack action.

Spellcasting
If a monster can cast any spells, its stat block lists
the spells and provides the monster’s spellcasting
ability, spell save DC (if any spells require a saving
throw), and spell attack bonus (if any spells require
an attack roll). Unless noted otherwise, a spell of
level 1 or higher is always cast at its lowest possible
level and can’t be cast at a higher level.
A monster’s spell can have special rules or restric-
tions. For example, a green hag can cast the Invisi-
bility spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction,
which means the spell affects only the hag.
Spell Components. The Spellcasting trait notes
whether the monster’s spellcasting ignores the
need for certain spell components. If any spell com-
ponents are required, describe the monster’s use of
Verbal, Somatic, or Material components to signal to
characters that it is casting a spell. A monster that
requires Material components has them.
Casting Times of 1+ Minutes. If a spell has a cast-
ing time of 1 minute or more yet is listed in a spell-
casting action, the monster doesn’t cast the spell in
just one action unless the action’s description states
otherwise; the monster must take the Magic action
on each of its turns and maintain Concentration to
cast the spell, as described in “Rules Glossary.”
Bonus Action

If a monster has Bonus Action options, they are
listed in this section. See “Playing the Game” for de-
tails on Bonus Actions.

Reactions

If the monster has Reaction options, those are listed
in this section along with their triggers. See “Play-
ing the Game” for details on Reactions.
Legendary Actions

If the monster has Legendary Action options, those
are listed in this section. A Legendary Action is an
action that a monster can take immediately after
another creature’s turn. Only one of these actions
can be taken at a time and only after another crea-
ture’s turn ends. The monster can’t take a Legend-
ary Action if it has the Incapacitated condition or is
otherwise unable to take actions.
The monster has a limited number of Legendary
Action uses, and that number is specified in the
stat block. The monster expends one use whenever
it takes a Legendary Action, and it regains all ex-
pended uses at the start of each of its turns.
Limited Usage

Some parts of a stat block have restrictions on the
number of times they can be used. Here are the
most common ways that usage is limited:

X/Day. This notation means the stat block part can
be used a certain number of times (represented
by X) and that a monster must finish a Long Rest
to regain expended uses. For example, a Reaction
that includes “1/Day” means the Reaction can be
taken once and that the monster must finish a
Long Rest to take it again.
Recharge X–Y. This notation means a monster
can use the stat block part once. At the start of
each of the monster’s turns, roll 1d6. If the roll
is within the number range given in the notation
(represented by X–Y), the monster regains the use
of that part, which also recharges when the mon-
ster finishes a Short or Long Rest. For example,
“Recharge 5–6” in an action means a monster can
take the action once. Then, at the start of each of
the monster’s turns, it regains the use of that ac-
tion if it rolls a 5 or 6 on 1d6.
Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This nota-
tion means the monster can use the stat block
part once and must then finish a Short or Long
Rest to use it again.
