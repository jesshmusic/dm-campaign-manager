        "desc": "The three main pillars of D&D play are social in-teraction, exploration, and combat. Whichever oneyouâre experiencing, the game unfolds according tothis basic pattern: This pattern holds during every game session (each time you sit down to play D&D), whether the adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, or fighting a dragon. In certain situations - particularly combat - the action is more structured, and everyone takes turns. Exceptions Supersede General Rules General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee at- tacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn't explicitly say otherwise. The game also includes elementsâclass features, feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the likeâthat sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.

        "desc": "All creatures â characters and monsters â have six abilities that measure physical and mental characteristics, as shown on the Ability Descriptions table. Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some monsters have a score as high as 30. The score represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability Scores table summarizes what the scores mean. Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you make a D20 Test with that ability (explained in âD20 Testsâ). An ability modifier is derived from its score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table. Round Down Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make an exception and tell you to round up."

        "slug": "d20-tests",
        "desc": "When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game uses a d20 roll to determine success or failure. These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. They follow these steps: An ability check represents a creature using talent and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertaining a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The GM and the rules often call for an ability check when a creature attempts something other than an attack that has a chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice determine the result. An ability check is named for the ability modifier it uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so on. Different ability checks are called for in different situations, depending on which ability is most relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for examples of each check's use. Add your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check when the GM determines that a skill or tool proficiency is relevant to the check and you have that proficiency. For example, if a rule refers to a Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to the check if you have proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See âProficiencyâ later in âPlaying the Gameâ for more information about skill and tool proficiencies. The Difficulty Class of an ability check represents the task's difficulty. The more difficult the task, the higher its DC. The rules provide DCs for certain checks, but the GM ultimately sets them. The Typical Difficulty Classes table presents a range of possible DCs for ability checks."

        "desc": "Characters and monsters are good at various things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while others can use only a few. Some are better at under- standing people's motives, and others are better at unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature's capabilities. A character's Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels (described in âCharacter Creationâ). A monster's Proficiency Bonus is based on its Challenge Rating (see âRules Glossaryâ). The Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is determined. This bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or with an item that the creature uses to make the D20 Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the DC of saving throws for spells. Your Proficiency Bonus can't be added to a die roll or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus if you're proficient in either skill, but you don't add it twice if you're proficient in both skills. Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before being added. For example, the Expertise feature (see âRules Glossaryâ) doubles the Proficiency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided only once. Most ability checks involve using a skill, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an ability check. The descriptions of the actions you take (see âActionsâ later in âPlaying the Gameâ) specify which skill applies if you make an ability check for that action, and many other rules note when a skill is relevant. The GM has the ultimate say on whether a skill is relevant in a situation."

        "desc": "When you do something other than moving or communicating, you typically take an action. The Action table lists the game's main actions, which are defined in more detail in âRules Glossary.â Player characters and monsters can also do things not covered by these actions. Many class features and other abilities provide additional action options, and you can improvise other actions. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the Game Master tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to make, if any. The game uses actions to govern how much you can do at one time. You can take only one action at a time. This principle is most important in combat, as explained in âCombatâ later in âPlaying the Game.â Actions can come up in other situations, too: in a social interaction, you can try to Influence a creature or use the Search action to read the creature's body language, but you can't do both at the same time. And when you're exploring a dungeon, you can't simultaneously use the Search action to look for traps and use the Help action to aid another character who's trying to open a stuck door (with the Utilize action). Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a Bonus Action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a Rogue to take a Bonus Action. You can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability, a spell, or another feature of the game states that you can do something as a Bonus Action. You other- wise donât have a Bonus Action to take."

        "desc": "During their adventures, player characters meet many different people and face some monsters that would rather talk than fight. In those situations, it's time for social interaction, which takes many forms. For example, you might try to convince a burglar to confess to wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard. The Game Master assumes the roles of any nonplayer characters who are participating. An NPCâs attitude toward your character is Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile, as defined in âRules Glossary.â Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help, and Hostile ones are inclined to hinder. Social interactions progress in two ways: through roleplaying and ability checks. Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it's you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. As you roleplay, consider whether you prefer an active approach or a descriptive approach."

The rules in this section detail some of the ways adventurers interact with the environment in such places. As adventurers explore, their equipment can help them in many ways. For example, they can reach out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things they wouldn't otherwise notice with a Torch or another light source, bypass locked doors and containers with Thievesâ Tools, and create obstacles for pursuers with Caltrops. See âEquipmentâ for rules on many items that are useful on adventures. The items in the âToolsâ and âAdventuring Gearâ sections are especially useful. The weapons in âEquipmentâ can also be used for more than battle; you could use a Quarterstaff, for example, to push a sinister-looking button that you're reluctant to touch. Some adventuring tasks â such as noticing danger, hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells â are affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can hinder you, as explained below. An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a Lightly Obscured area â such as an area with Dim Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage â you have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight."

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side is defeated. Combat unfolds in these steps: Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check that determines their place in the Initiative order. The GM rolls for monsters. For a group of identical creatures, the GM makes a single roll, so each member of the group has the same Initiative. Surprise.If a combatant is surprised by combat starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their Initiative roll. For example, if an ambusher starts combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware that combat is starting, that foe is surprised."

Hit Point loss has no effect on your capabilities until you reach 0 Hit Points.
